      "{'taylor-original.wav': \" Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began I was 20 years old and I had put out my self titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys and I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of push back but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. Alright. Okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No. That criticism is reserved for us. But you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo. Rosalia. Taylor Parks. Julie Kiyoko. King Princess. Camila Cabello. Halsey. Megan Vistallian. Princess Nokia. Nina Nezbit. Sigrid. Normani. Her. Maggie Rogers. Becky G. Do Alipa. Ella May. Philly Eilish. And so many other amazing women who are making music right now. No artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\", 'margot-to-linus.wav': \" Oh, okay. Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligations, so he asked me to read his response for him. Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, how'd you just became single? Welcome to the club. Oh, Britain, you're the best with the divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank for uses David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arian Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Ole May Simon-Jones and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, it's a bit much really, oh, and he says that he is gonna name this Harry because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\", 'obama-to-linus.wav': \" So now, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The belief that we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts. But for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time, by the way, we had to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made indeporous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a heart-fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country full. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last 40 years, America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Pleasanton, Kenny Valdek and I hope you all have a great day. I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of you for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first yay. Sasha and Malia, before our very eyes, they are growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women just like your mom. And I am so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. Until the best campaign to and volunteers Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made to get. You will add the lifelong the appreciation of the grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of eagles or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the rope line in a high school gym, we saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the Lopthalotto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. The port, the math, the sea and the nation up 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's feet. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality. It isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\", 'biden-to-margot.wav': \" my fellow Americans. And the people of Guatemala made the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpardown there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sister's along my sister, Valerie, and that, it was. Bubbles, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most of those ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me. Tonight, we're seeing all of this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better name. And I am humbled by the trust in confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who does receive ring states and blue states, only sees the United States. I work for all of my horror, so the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not gonna see it at home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sustman. And I look now figure, without their love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my horror. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She's dedicated and liked to educate you, but teaching is a gesture she does. It's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. And Jill, through the Medicare, great first lady. I'm so proud of her now. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just served from Kamala Ayers. You're the first woman. You're the first woman. The first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant. Ever looked at this country. You're the most happy of me, the host of the whole United States. It's all over now. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard. For so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white man with no way out. Well, long time you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers and all gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. The dollos who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, Ray. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republican independence, Progressive, moderate, conservative, young and old, Irman, suburban, rural, gay, straight, straight, gendered, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as low as that. The African-American community stood up against the government. I'm almost in my nightmare, and I'm not new-lose. I said in the Alex said, I want to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what the administration will look like and act like roll-loves of you. Who vote who president Trump? I understand the disappointment like that. I've lost a couple of times myself, but now let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen each other again. And the main progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of the people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America has cloned upon us to most of the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to most of the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the Battle of Control and the Virus, the Battle of the Milk Frost Fairy, the Battle of Secure, your family's health care, the Battle of Achieve, Racial Justice, and Rudatta, systemic racism in this country. And the Battle of the same old plan might get a climate under control. The Battle of Restore, decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our worry gets with getting COVID under control. We cannot prepare the economy restored by Taliban, or really life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get under control. On Monday, I will name a group of meeting scientists and experts as transition advisors to help them take the Biden hierarchy of COVID-19 and convert it into an active blueprint that will start on January 20th, 2021. The airplane will be built on bedrock science, but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me, as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We hope that the president will be able to come in and give us a big applause. A refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, it's not something to do, but one of the most interesting American people, they want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make, and I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\", 'margot-to-obama.wav': \" Oh, that's it.

He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, he is going to name this Harry, because he is really excited about bringing about to the States with him.\", 'linus-to-trump.wav': \" Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Full Plane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking... This feels ridiculous and I've never really outbrewed that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, many of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. They can really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't. Fairfuly rate that sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You want and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Hivon and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money will make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I can be my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, in compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping in to undermine him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break something really all the how-dats. With bad out of the way, then, who else is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So, this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and me, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and dealt, both of which have been successful enough, but they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. If I'm excited to work with my friend again, I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, female source of tech information on the left. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for putting you mad, I've been.

But it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys to that content that I can.\", 'trump-original.wav': \" I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard fort campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, hours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They are great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. The Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Chris. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. Hey, that Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Very strong. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the Chatta? Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\", 'obama-to-ryan.wav': \" To now, for the 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, test a perfecting our union, boost forward. In most forward because of you, in most forward because you re-abirm the spirit that is triumphed over war and oppression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation had a year. Tonight in this election, you, the American people, remind us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have bought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. Oh, I thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you vote in for the very first time or wait in line for a very long time, by the way we have to fix that. Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the bomb, whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an japerous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Fran and partner of the last four years. America's Happy Warrior, the best-mife pleasant and anything ever. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first year. Sasha Malia, for our very eyes, we're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys but I will say that for now one dog's probably in them. So the best campaign tea and ball of tears in the history of our world. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the life long appreciation of the great president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of butter for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest to be goes or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out of our rallies and crowded along the road line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is waiting through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism and the voice of a military spouses working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job for a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are risking their lives right now, just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Up country that leads up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\", 'biden-to-taylor.wav': \" my fellow Americans. And the people abroad made the dance, Delawareans. I see Mike Buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? Annabte former Governor Ruth Ann Minner? Most importantly, my sisters long my sister, Valerie, and Adiwork. Globos, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people, we won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket, and the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, a surprise may, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president, who seeks not to divide, but unify. We've got to see red states and blue states, only sees the United States. And work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not enough's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the worker making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure, without her love, entirely support of Jill, and my son Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my aunt, Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated to life education, for teaching as a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's for the American, great first lady. I'm so proud of him. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just served from Kamai-Arts. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't not tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's all over now. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamai-Dum, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white man with no way out. All of us who you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic, look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all gave so much to themselves to make this move possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. But all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and defendants, progressive moderates, conservatives, young and old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, dating the marion. I made it, especially those moments, and especially those moments with this campaign was as most as the African-American community still doesn't forget that for me. And all this has not gotten out of my world. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent a look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration to look like an act like Donald Trump's a mutant. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment lately. I've lost a couple times myself, but now, let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. The Bible tells us to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of virus, the battle of the Vilprosperia, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice and rule out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hope's our war we're getting to getting COVID under control. We cannot prepare the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors. To hell, take the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and convert it into an active blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America, begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we may. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests. And that's the choice I'll make. Call up Congress, Democrats.\", 'Obama-to-Biden.wav': \" So now, more than 200 years after a former colony won the White to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.

And the people who brought me to dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minder. Most importantly, my sisters and all my sister-vallering, Delaware. Fulves, the people this nation have spoken, they delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, with one with the most votes, ever cast some presidents of ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide what unify. Who does receive rent states and loose states only sees the United States. To work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of him. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, seared whole. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, detest of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without their low and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Axe and my daughter, and all our great children, and their spouses, and all our family. That in my heart, Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She's dedicated her life to education, but she is a jester, she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You don't have one of your own in the White House. The children of the men can be great first lady, I'm so proud of them. I'm so proud of them. Well, I'll have the honor of serving with the fantastic Vice President, be just served from Kamala Airs. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. You don't know how many of us, not in the hospital in the United States? The Slough Over and Down. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years, to make this happen, once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white woman with no way out. But all of us are you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all of the volunteers, and all of the gate so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, I'm proud of the coalition we fought together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Moderates, Conservatives, Young and Old, Irons, Suburban, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgender, Weight, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as low as death, the African-American community stood up against the warmen. And I don't have the young ones. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what our administration will look like and act like, for all moms of you, who voted President Trump, I understand the disappointment like, I've lost a couple times myself, but now, let's keep each other in peace. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again, and to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. The mouth of this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America has called upon us to more some of the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to more some of the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of Irish, the battle of the Bill Prosper, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot, that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hooks, are working again to getting COVID under control. We cannot in prayer in the economy, restore our vitality, or really its life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors, to help the Biden-Harris-Coward-Planet converter and to an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but we can structure it out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work this hard for those who didn't vote for me, and those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we may, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I have the way that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats,\", 'margot-to-biden.wav': \" Hello. Okay.

And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creative Warehouse, and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous. And I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, a wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. We really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what is very pretty right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera and just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at Floplink.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the back pack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivan and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. Integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team, beyond that though. The buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. But that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because netting me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, the grudging shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've afforded all of my previous attempts to hire him. So usually since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I've talked to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go... I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the female source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bulls**t. This super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at Yo-Sekr, if you want to go dig up something z old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for bringing that up and sorry for turning your introduction here into this segway.

And that former Governor Ruth Ann Leonard. Most importantly, my sisters longed my sister Valorant. And they were. Fubless, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the next teeth of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it's surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, are not forming a joy of all of renewed faith in tomorrow. Bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide and but unify. Who does who seek red states and blue states only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart for the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America I believe is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. That's united us here at home. It's the other my like time that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sussman. And I look not fear without their love and tireless support of Jill and my son Hunter and actually my daughter and all our grandchildren and its fathers and all our family. That my heart. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated and liked education. But she is a gesture she does. And she is. For American educators, this is a great day for y'all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The children of America, great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. We make history as a first woman. First black woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of Remembrance. Ever elected in this country. Y'all look at how little need is still possible in the United States. Small over and over. Have we reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc for the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, why can't I not? You're family. You become an honorary Biden. There's no way out. Well, all along, we volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. We'll elect officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, Rand. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, and the Fedants. Progressive, modern, conservatives. Young, old, urban, suburban, rural. Gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian. Dean of the Baron. I mean, especially those moments. And especially those moments when this campaign was the most ever. The Afro-Cur-American community stood up for the government. The whole world sees it not right. And I don't know if you'll lose. I said in the outset that I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that I'm still on their midestinction to look like an act. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment. I've lost a couple of dives myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season. The time to build. The time to reap and the time to sow. And the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America would call upon us to moreso the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to moreso the forces of science, and the forces of horror, and the great battles of our time. The battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Beltfrost period, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of a chief racial justice, and ruled out systemic racism in this country. The battle to sing our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of a store of decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Well, our war against from getting COVID under control. We can now, in prayering the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments. Hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the loans that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help us take the Biden Harris Corridor Plan to convert her into an actual blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2020. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did, and I will make sure that the Biden Harris Corridor Plan is ready to be a winner. I will make sure that the Biden Harris Corridor Plan will be a winner. For those who didn't vote for me as those who did, let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We're in fusedle of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. I'm going to have two cooperate, and I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests, and that's the choice I'll make, and I'll call on Congress.\", 'obama-to-musk.wav': \" Tonel for the two hundred years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny. The task of perfecting our union boosts forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and oppression. The spirit that has led to this country from the depths of the spirit of the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams. We are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. Tonight in this election you, the American people, remind us that while our road has been hard.

Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the power. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign. You made your voice heard and you made indepference. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply. And we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Rom to talk about where we can work together and move this country forward.

And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed of marrying me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I never loved you more.

You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a child or roof over the head.

And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Our country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.

So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell a story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from AuthSeaClock which said that a efficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stateful. Being able to fly, that's crazy. Being able to see overland distances, being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, would be considered magic in time is passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times passed. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff, you know, did a few things here and there, one of which was PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial I thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all of your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and works smoothly. And then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is it. I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close as loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. Going from PayPal, if that's a revolp, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that the sensory root, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the lactarase the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought well if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land sea with sea- some dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hybrid them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life has ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the finished outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the outside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in in late 2000, in late 2000, in 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy, but I did have money. So that was okay. After making silver trips to Russia, I can't see the inclusion. And actually my initial impression was wrong because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond and have a Mars based on that kind of thing. But I can't include that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers. People have came here from other plots in the world. I think the United States is a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then what's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip by Syracuse, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the normal rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical type of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\", 'linus-to-obama.wav': \" Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired, but really can't do this anymore tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding, we're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, they're not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at fullplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares, and the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Take lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency, or the snacks in the lunchroom, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that, and that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy right now? The key item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because Natajing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, the fun being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this shit, but now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ebony Bond, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**t. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background and media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren.

And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as an individual, if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically, to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 1995, and that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, it's the important that we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. So it did some internet stuff, a few things here and there, one of which is PayPal. And maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So it'd be at one place where all of your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. And we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy, and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as close, loop as possible. So we focused on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them. And you correct your prior assumptions. And then, going from PayPal, whether it will, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? Really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that, the century is the century where we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multiplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, I actually initially thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought, well, if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would last with the dehydrate, with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in 2000, like 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. But that's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. After making silver trucks to Russia, I camped inclusion. My initial impression was wrong about that. Because my mission thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond having a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't include that. That was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers of people that came here from other plots of the world. I think the United States is just a distillation of the spread of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then it's going to completely break the federal budget and then up and do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I didn't think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I'm not built like the model rockets as a kid. And I kind of think I never had a company that built any physical set-craft figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\", 'linus-to-taylor.wav': \" Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like why now? What's going to happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge. Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't the hopefully rate that, sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Iban and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a, I'll call up the manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community, that's you, and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at flipplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. He, Vaughn and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, it's a little make lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lend room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean for all the need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes me kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, be grudging shut out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worked so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about he bought on his the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the lab. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to procure a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Because that is funny, as I think it is, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren.

And the people who brought me the dance, Deloarians. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think, Senator Coons is there, and I think the government is around him. Is that Ruth Ann? In that former Governor Ruth Ann Minard. Most importantly, my sister's law, my sister's valouring. Anyway. Well, most people this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, as surprised many, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, unapproving the joy of hope renewed, faithed, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. We'll do just to see Red Stage and Blue Stage only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, sincere home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a test, the test of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without their love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Ashley, and my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, have all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated and liked education, but she is a gesture she does. It's who she is. For a mere good educator, it's just a great day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's gonna make a great first lady. I'm so proud of him. I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't know, she has a least possible in the United States. Small over a new, and we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, done, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary Biden with no way out. Law lobes and you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Lock them elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, law of the volunteers, and all gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. It all lobes, who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition that is to me, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Moderates, Conservatives, Young and all, Irvents, Suburbant, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgendered, White, Latino, Asian, Native American. I made it especially in those moments. And especially in those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African American community stood up for the government. And all we'll see in my daughter, and I'll have you all. I said in the Alex said, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's a lot of the administration to look like an act. I probably won't be able to. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment I had. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, the time to build, the time to reap, and the time to sow, and the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, a mayor of the people called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of hope, in the great battles of our time, the battle of control and the virus, the battle of the Vilprosth barrier, the battle of the secure, your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Whoops! Our war never again took getting COVID under control. We cannot have an apparent economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and Converter into an action blueprint that will start on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\", 'musk-original.wav': \" description. So I thought, I try to think, what is the most useful thing that I could, what could I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future? And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Autocie Clock, which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, and that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 1995. That's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. And obviously, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so did some internet stuff.

And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. They thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong. Because my initial thought was that there was not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I came to the conclusion that that was wrong.

I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. And this decade began, I was 20 years old and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. No, take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever you got to give it to. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album Speak Now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break up songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Others saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us but you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal styleings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kyoko, King Princess, and the audience, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Distallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Deweleepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. While artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record, and ticket sales, and critical acclaim, so why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\", 'musk-to-trump.wav': \" description. So I thought, I started to go, what is the most useful thing that I can, what did I say that could actually help for useful tea in the future? And I thought, perhaps tell the story of how I came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was a young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quirk from Odyssey Club, which said that, especially advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today could be burned at the stake for being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet, a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information, it instantly from almost anywhere near. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. That weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's important that we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. It did a few things here and there. One of which was PayPal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an ennagglomeration of financial services. So it would be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the ennagglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy. And everybody was interested. So I think it's important to take the feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. And then, oh, yeah. The going from PayPal, I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-boarded best way to make money, which is OK. But what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the sensory is the sensory, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX. And the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with dehydrate, which sees the dehydrated nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life of seven travelers, as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the finance outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2000, 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought that the withdraw was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond, if I have a mouse base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. People who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets glowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. It was tough going there in the beginning, because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the model rockets as a kid, and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. It's that guy who figured out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\", 'trump-to-musk.wav': \" I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard forked campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I will let her succeed. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous critichers. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure. Which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, conflict. And now, I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on many workmen. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert, they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy, fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. Tomalania and Don. Steve Anker and Eric Antiphany and Baron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great girl. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne, and Chris, and Rudy, and Steve and David, we have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy, Julianne. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. They never changed it. Where's Rudy? Where is him? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, folks. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that's here? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I get to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats.

Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, Hojji just became single. Welcome to the club. Hojji! Which is you've invested with the divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been to be intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo in the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arianne Phillips, where he is also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Ole May Simon Jones, and the one and only went in Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we fight over the top. It can tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of amount of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had. On a film, my lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on, so that I could have this experience, which surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you.

It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and oppression. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? Or a little in line for a very long time? By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an debt with. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply. We care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son, Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Rinn and partner of the last 40 years. America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Plansonon, Hany Gaudi, can handle hope for Joe Biden. I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first Yagga. Sasha Malit, for poor our very eyes, they're growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. To the best, campaign team and volunteers for her history are powerful. For us. The best, Abra. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. You will have the life long appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in the high school gym, or saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the termination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phone's late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or roof over the head who I make her heart. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are wasting their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. I come to a that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.

And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide or unify. Who does not see rents, states, and blue states only sees the United States. To work for all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's united as she had hoped. It's the un-out-my-like time, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without her love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. But it might hurt, she'll have some mom, a military mom, an educator. And she's dedicated her life to education. But she is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For a moment, educators, it's a great day for y'all. You can have one of your own in the White House. The gentleman, that's a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic voice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia descent, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. You're not here to let me, it's not possible in the United States. It's slow over and narrow. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white woman with no way out. All along, you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. In my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built in Rio. I'm proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and the patents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young and old, early and suburban, rural, Gace, trade, transgender, Wayne, Latino, Asia, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments, especially those moments with this campaign was as low as death. The African-American community stood up, I get it for them. We've always seen my brother and I have you, folks. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration who looked like an actor, all of us have you in. Who learned from President Trump, I understand you're disappointed, neither. I've lost the couple of times myself, but now let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the horsewredder at lower than temperature. Let's see each other again, let's see each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The violent tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America called upon us to morph into the forces of decency, the forces of failures, to morph into the forces of science, and the forces of hope. In the great violence of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Bill Cross Berder, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. In the battle, the same old planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our world began to get in control of the world. We can now prepare the economy, restore it by talisman, or relish life's most precious moments of getting our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all along with some matter most of us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris Covert planning converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. While I will govern as an American president, I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim error of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We refuse all of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we may, and we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make, and I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\", 'taylor-to-obama.wav': \" Absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Take it. Hey. APPLAUSE Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award, with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You've got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback. But I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would work constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along. And I would keep accommodating, overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. OK, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now, they're saying my album, Red, is filled with too many break-ups songs. OK, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. So they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. OK, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? It's a... Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. OK, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business moment. OK, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. OK, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Monica Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you very much. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Ear at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kioco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan D'Estalion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Fur, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements, women in music, on stage or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings. Because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dongeo? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate. As it...\", 'margot-original.wav': \" Oh, okay.

Test of perfecting our union, boost forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you we affirm the spirit that has triumphed over war and the question. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of the spirit of the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams. We are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. It has one nation and it's nothing. Tonight in this election you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard. While our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? For a little inline for a very long time. By the way, we had to fix that. But you pound in the pavement or take up the pung. What are you held in Obamasine or a Romney sign? You made your voice heard and you made a difference. I just spoke with Governor Ronny and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a heartfelt campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Ronny to talk about where we can work together in this country pool. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years.

Some of you renew this time around and some of you haven't been at my side since the very begin. But all of you are a family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will add the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing in all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all of the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. Annette provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out a rallies crowded along the road line in a high school gym or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections, man. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change actor tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. But chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's speech. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best foods and the best teachers. Our country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burned by death, that isn't weakened by any polym.

Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. It's done.

For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgot men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airport schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got been so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll go through it. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny. And dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things. And successful plans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict.

He says he has always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says, he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo, and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. His old makes, Simon Jones, and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, he is going to name this Harry, because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\", 'trump-to-Biden.wav': \" I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. And remember that, Larry C.C. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. I have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. Time. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. From Mendis Patrachio, I've got to know our country so well from Mendis Patrachio, it's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. So, forgot men and women of our country will be forgot no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airport schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure. Which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond how we reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny. And dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great movement. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanna Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. He should all be on this stage, but that's okay. Very great. And also my late brother, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tomalania and Don. Andy Vanka. And Garrick. And Tiffany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kelly Ann. And Chris. And Rudy. And Steve. And David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. And that Rudy never changed. It's a risk-routing. Where is him? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, girl. The first man, first senator, first major major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington. Because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Thank you. Great man. Another great man. Very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the channel? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor. Because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\", 'ryan-to-linus.wav': \" This isn't the first time I've been mistaken for Ryan Reynolds, but it's getting out of hand. Ryan, obviously, there's been some kind of mistake, but I'm up here. So if you don't mind. OK. Damien and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what peace and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top. It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people. And there's just no time to think everyone. I just like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on, so that I could have this experience, would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you. It's my daughter's amada and Esmeralda. I love you. And if I may, I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendez. Thank you very much to the HFVA.

Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Uh-huh. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first thank Bill Bord from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Bill Bord for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry. And I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do, is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires for inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When fearless did win album of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice, was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would twerk constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating. Overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakups songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989. Oh, you heard it. Fag. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation, and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. Now, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this, who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alma the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella May, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us, made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity, coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate. As it...\", 'linus-to-musk.wav': \" Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Footplay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And Chief Among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. I'm tired and if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We've thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now, like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're now going to get to that leader. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I don't have a really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've all and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having them work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at FloatPlanet.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. You've on and I are still the soul shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives for our kids to do that and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, it's because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our missions complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me well, whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge with that. And that is by design. You've all and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you was actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position because that engine meat is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's want to be only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybony who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Because that is funny as I think it is, you know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker. If you want to go dig up something his old articles for fun, sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up.

So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could work with, I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othessey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stakeful, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the wealth information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, it would be considered magic in time has passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagine in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always said sort of a slight existential crisis. So I was trying to figure out what does it all mean? Like what's the purpose of things? And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles. Basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's the you, fortunately, we're past graduation. So I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. There are a few things here and there. One of which is PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to, let me say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we have like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments, which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You know, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you see them. And you're correct, your prior assumptions. And then, oh, it's going from Paypal. I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-warded best way to make money. Which is okay, but what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we're doing so, the sensory work wouldn't be trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the lateral basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, and you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. But public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life-sever travel as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited and therefore increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in the late 2000s, in the late 2000s, in the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was that was okay. And after making several trips to Russia, I kept inclusion. That did actually, my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people that came here from other plots in the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I built like the model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. It's that kind of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\", 'biden-original.wav': \" my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters and my sisters and my sisters, Valerie. Anyway. Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states only sees the United States. And work for all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, it's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill and my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren. And their spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated to her life to education. But she teaches it just what she does, it's who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's going to make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President. He just served from Kamala Harris. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of an immigrant. Ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's long overdue. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family. You're becoming honorary Biden. There's no way out. All those of you volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers. And all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Modders, Conservatives. Young old, Urban, Suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments. And especially those moments with this campaign was that as low as they ever. The African-American community stood up again for a minute. He's my banner. And I'll have yours. I said at the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what I think the administration will look like and act like. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. Americans have called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of fairness. The forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint. That will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim air of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats.\", 'trump-to-taylor.wav': \" I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I owe that for her sincere. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life on business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So Mendez Patensil, I've gotten to know our country so well from Mendez Patensil. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, or veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage that tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. And go, I'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world to me anity that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on moon right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth. We're here with us tonight. And wherever they're here someplace, they're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They are great. And also my late brother Fred, great guy, fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. I'm Maria and Dawn. And Ivanka and Derek and Tiffany and Baron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. They that rooted, never changed. It was rooting. Where is it? I'm rooting. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was. I don't know. Thank you, but the first man, first senator, first major, major politician, let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's a smart, as you get, senator Jeff Sessions. Thank you. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor of the tune up? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating.

I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top? It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. So, Ars, thank you.

Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Floatplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like, really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I have some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. And I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I'm not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives. For our kids to do that. And for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it. And there were a few reasons for that. First is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do? Buy an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivon and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first. We want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then. Who the hell is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really. One of our other colleagues, be grudging shout out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shout out Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. Damn, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Yvonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail. And not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up.

I still can't watch it just to find the timestamps for what I'd put in the video earlier. I had to just download a transcript and it's just rough. But it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys the best content that I can.\", 'taylor-to-ryan.wav': \" I absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a... It's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think, Billboard, from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 21 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you are male producer or a co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I could stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo Rosalia Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan B. Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, LMA, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling, standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Currently there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\", 'linus-to-ryan.wav': \" Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Five days coming up, luckily Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our world compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, sorry, first I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've on and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Ivan and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who may hell's this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and, I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. And I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just a deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. The super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at EOSECR. If you want to go dig up some of the sold articles for fun, sorry, Taren. Sorry for putting you mad up. Sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. On this decade began, I was one years old and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be better, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Well, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award. With that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before, as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, but just clever. You've got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now, and that I would twerk constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. They're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. Do you heard it? Fig. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in the Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Keoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Colesie, Megan B. Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, Ella May, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters and creators. And I hope that you all know that. Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\", 'musk-to-ryan.wav': \" corruption. So I thought I tried the word what is the most useful thing that I could what did I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell a story of how I came to be here how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what it's going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is this is stuff that that really would be magic or be considered magic in time is passed in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagined in time's past they weren't even in the realm of magic so that it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology then that's like magic and I would be really cool and that the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean like what's the purpose of things and I can't really conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and that's really the only way forward so so I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how how the economy works and you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participating in the internet and be a part of it so I decided to drop out now it's the you fortunately we're we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so did some internet stuff a bit of few things here and there one of which is PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was was kind of how it started because initially the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we show the show the system off to someone we'd show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which is quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment no you want to be as close to live as possible and so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we would probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions and then the going from Cape Al at the will what what is some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to to make money which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem with Gaunt is sustainable energy both the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't sell that the sensory is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make five multi-planetary so that's that's that's the basis for the the latter is the basis for for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and and solar city and and when I started SpaceX it actually initially I thought that well there's there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow something called Mars Oasis which would land seeds with dehydrate with with season dehydrated nutrient gel you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on the red background and the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the first the life of travel as far as we know and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase at NASA's budget so so obviously we can ask outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 like 2000 one 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the Nick that's a lot more and that was 10 years ago I guess so they they they Mithura was crazy but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to inclusion that did actually my initial impression was was wrong about that because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars based and that kind of thing but I can't there's not that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other plots the world I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but if people think it's impossible then or it's gonna completely break the federal budget then they're not gonna do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to but one friend maybe sit down and watch a bunch of videos rockets glowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think it was it was tap going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I built like for the Marvel rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built an even physical set up figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and so we did all that and and then failed three times\", 'trump-to-ryan.wav': \" I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard, and a Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I remember that very soon she met me. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So, Mendis potential, I've got to know our country so well from Mendis potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. So, forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18 month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent. For the benefit of all, it's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clings once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict.

So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. So I did some internet stuff, did a few things here and there. One of which was Paypal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of Paypal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought with Paypal was to create an agglomeration of financial services to be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, live as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and you're correct your prior assumptions. And then, going from Paypal, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the century were in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for space X and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started space X, I actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with D-hydrate with C-s and D-hydrate at nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing, and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the refinash outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. And so anything better than that was on the upside. And so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2001, 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So they thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was okay. After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond growth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. If people came here from other plots of the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then at or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the one with rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built anything physical. It's had that figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\", 'margot-to-ryan.wav': \" Oh, okay. Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligations, so he asked me to read his response for him.

She can graduated us. It's about us, one-hour victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I'm very, very sincere. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Done. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which they will worry a few people. I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, our was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement. Made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I'm spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So, Mendez Patentio, I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got many, so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, or veterans, or incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage the tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clings once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. While people and all other nations, we will see common ground, not hostility, heartmorship, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents who I know are looking down one man right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're over. They're here some plants. They're very shy actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on the stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tamalania and Don. And Ivanka. And Eric. And Tiffany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable, girl. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great girl. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kelly Anne, and Chris, and Rudy, and Steve and David. We have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you it's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. And Rudy. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. He said, Rudy, never change it. Where's Rudy? Where is it? Rudy. Oh, hey. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was on board. Thank you, girl. The first man for Senator, for his major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that's your name? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\", 'musk-to-obama.wav': \" description. So I thought I tried to think what was the most useful thing that I could what can I say that could actually help for useful tier in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was PNI, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othsey Claw which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagine in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a psych existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I can't include that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works.

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Um, I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was two years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music, and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and I saw that you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you're male producer or a co-writer, is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, let's take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, people had something to say about me. I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics, when Fearless did win Almabier at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award. And that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news I've come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? Fig. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticite. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And not example should inspire all of us. The only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezvit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Do Alipa, Ella May, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists and music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to advocate advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\", 'ryan-to-taylor.wav': \" This isn't the first time I've been mistaken for Ryan Reynolds, but it's getting out of hand.

And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we build, Ren, I'm proud of the coalition we've worked together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Modernist, Conservatives, Young and Old, Irvin, Suburban, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgender, White, Latino, Asian, Native Americans, I may be, especially those moments, especially those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African-American community stood on the fucking head for more than, with all those who are walking by there, and out of your own. I sit in the alley, I want to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's a lot of the administration to look like an actor. I pour all of those at you, who voted for President Trump. I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of dives myself, but now I'm not going to be able to do it but now let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, and this will each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, a marriage that's called upon us, to the force of the decency, the forces of fairness, to the force of science, and the forces of hope, and the great values of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieved racial justice, and ruled out systemic racism in this country. The battle of the same art planet by getting climate under control, the battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and gave everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our ordinary gang is getting COVID under control. We can now, in preparing the economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get an under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help the Biden-Harris Covert and Converter into an action-blue print that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, or be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work as horror for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The Republicans will be republished the Co-operate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. An athlete that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people, they want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\"}\n",

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began I was 20 years old and I had put out my self titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys and I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of push back but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. Alright. Okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No. That criticism is reserved for us. But you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo. Rosalia. Taylor Parks. Julie Kiyoko. King Princess. Camila Cabello. Halsey. Megan Vistallian. Princess Nokia. Nina Nezbit. Sigrid. Normani. Her. Maggie Rogers. Becky G. Do Alipa. Ella May. Philly Eilish. And so many other amazing women who are making music right now. No artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  So now, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The belief that we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts. But for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time, by the way, we had to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made indeporous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a heart-fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country full. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last 40 years, America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Pleasanton, Kenny Valdek and I hope you all have a great day. I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of you for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first yay. Sasha and Malia, before our very eyes, they are growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women just like your mom. And I am so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. Till the best championship and companies, remember history was bad. The best ever... Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made to get. You will have the life on the appreciation of the grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of eagles or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the rope line in a high school gym, we saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the Lopthalotto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. The port, the math, the sea and the nation up 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's feet. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality. It isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

Bubbles, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most of those ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me. Tonight, we're seeing all of this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better name. And I am humbled by the trust in confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who does receive ring states and blue states, only sees the United States. I work for all of my horror, so the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not going to see it whole. It's you not having my lifetime. There's so many millions of Americans that voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sussman. And I look not featured, without their love and tireless support of Jill. And my son Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my horror. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She's dedicated and liked to educate you, but teaching is a gesture she does. It's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill, you're the Medicare Great First Lady. I'm so proud of them now. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Ayers. The first woman, the first woman from South Asia, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever looked at this country. You know what, no tell me, it's not possible in the United States. It's all over now. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard. For so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary Biden with no way out. Well, long time you volunteer and work the polls. In the middle of the pandemic, look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers, and all gave so much to themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. The best thing is that you're going to have to do. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. The dollos who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, Ray. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republican independence, progress as modernist conservatives, young old Irman, suburban rural, gay, straight, transgendered, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean, especially those moments. And especially those moments when this campaign was as low as them. The African-American community stood up again for me. I'm almost in my night, and I'm not new moves. I sit in the annex and I want to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We don't know. Now that's what the administration will look like, an actor all loves a human. Who won't represent a drum? I understand the disappointment like that. I've lost a couple of times myself, but now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen each other again. And the main progress we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of the people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America has cloned upon us to most of the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to most of the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the Battle of Control of the Virus, the Battle of the Milk Frost Bearer, the Battle of Secure, your family's health care, the Battle of Achieve, racial justice, and Rudatta systemic racism in this country. And the Battle of the same heart plan if might get any climate under control, the Battle of Restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our worry gets with getting COVID under control. We can now prepare the economy, restore it by Taliban, or really slice most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get under control. On Monday, I will name a group of meeting scientists and experts as tradition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID Plan in converter and to an active blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. Deppin Flynn will be built on bedrock science but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans, the Kuwait-Ray with one another, is not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. One, that's too cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make, and I'll call on Congress Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Full Plane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking... This feels ridiculous and I've never really outbrewed that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, many of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. They can really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't. Fairfuly rate that sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You want and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Hivon and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money will make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I can be my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, in compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping in to undermine him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break something really all the how-dats. With bad out of the way, then, who else is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So, this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and me, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and dealt, both of which have been successful enough, but they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. If I'm excited to work with my friend again, I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, female source of tech information on the left. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for putting you mad, I've been. Sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard fort campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, hours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They are great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. The Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Chris. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. Hey, that Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Very strong. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the Chatta? Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

      "Transcription:  To now, for the 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, test a perfecting our union, boost forward. In most forward because of you, in most forward because you re-abirm the spirit that is triumphed over war and oppression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation had a year. Tonight in this election, you, the American people, remind us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have bought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. Oh, I thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you vote in for the very first time or wait in line for a very long time, by the way we have to fix that. Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the bomb, whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an japerous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Fran and partner of the last four years. America's Happy Warrior, the best-mife pleasant and anything ever. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first year. Sasha Malia, for our very eyes, we're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys but I will say that for now one dog's probably in them. So the best campaign tea and ball of tears in the history of our world. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the life long appreciation of the great president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of butter for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest to be goes or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out of our rallies and crowded along the road line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is waiting through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism and the voice of a military spouses working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job for a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are risking their lives right now, just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Up country that leads up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people abroad made the dance, Delawareans. I see Mike Buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? Annabte former Governor Ruth Ann Minner? Most importantly, my sisters long my sister, Valerie, and Adiwork. Globos, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people, we won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket, and the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, a surprise may, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president, who seeks not to divide, but unify. We've got to see red states and blue states, only sees the United States. And work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not enough's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the worker making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure, without her love, entirely support of Jill, and my son Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my aunt, Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated to life education, for teaching as a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's for the American, great first lady. I'm so proud of him. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just served from Kamai-Arts. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't not tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's all over now. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamai-Dum, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white man with no way out. All of us who you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic, look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all gave so much to themselves to make this move possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. But all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and defendants, progressive moderates, conservatives, young and old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, dating the marion. I made it, especially those moments, and especially those moments with this campaign was as most as the African-American community still doesn't forget that for me. And all this has not gotten out of my world. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent a look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration to look like an act like Donald Trump's a mutant. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment lately. I've lost a couple times myself, but now, let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. The Bible tells us to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of virus, the battle of the Vilprosperia, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice and rule out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hope's our war we're getting to getting COVID under control. We cannot prepare the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors. To hell, take the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and convert it into an active blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America, begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we may. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests. And that's the choice I'll make. Call up Congress, Democrats.\n",

I mean, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as most of the African-American community stood up against the government. All seemed like, and I don't have the old ones. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what the administration will look like and act like, for all moms of you. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment like, I've lost a couple times myself. But now, let's keep each other in peace. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America has called upon us to more some of the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to more some forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of iris, the battle of the built-prost barrier, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hooks are working again to getting COVID under control. We cannot in prayer and the economy restore our vitality, but really it's life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden Harris Co-Watts and Converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but we can structure it out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work this hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We are in the right place. We're in fusedle. A Democrat's Republic is the cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we may, and we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And out of the way, that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people, they want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  Hello. Okay. Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligations, so he asked me to read his response for him. Okay, he starts by saying, hey Britain, how did you just became single? Welcome to the club. Oh. Oh. We're seeing you vest with a divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arianne Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. His old makes Simon Jones and the one and only went in Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creative Warehouse, and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous. And I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, a wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. We really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what is very pretty right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera and just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at Floplink.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the back pack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivan and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. Integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team, beyond that though. The buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. But that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because netting me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, the grudging shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've afforded all of my previous attempts to hire him. So usually since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I've talked to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go... I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the female source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bulls**t. This super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at Yo-Sekr, if you want to go dig up something z old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for bringing that up and sorry for turning your introduction here into this segway.

It's just raw, but it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bring you guys to that content that I can.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. People have probably been dead to Delawareans. I see Mike Bunty, Senator Tom Carpord down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Leonard. Most importantly, my sisters longed my sister Valorant. And they were. Fubless, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the next teeth of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it's surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, are not forming a joy of all of renewed faith in tomorrow. Bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide and but unify. Who does who seek red states and blue states only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart for the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America I believe is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. That's united us here at home. It's the other my like time that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sussman. And I look not fear without their love and tireless support of Jill and my son Hunter and actually my daughter and all our grandchildren and its fathers and all our family. That my heart. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated and liked education. But she is a gesture she does. And she is. For American educators, this is a great day for y'all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The children of America, great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. We make history as a first woman. First black woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of Remembrance. Ever elected in this country. Y'all look at how little need is still possible in the United States. Small over and over. Have we reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc for the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, why can't I not? You're family. You become an honorary Biden. There's no way out. Well, all along, we volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. We'll elect officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, Rand. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, and the Fedants. Progressive, modern, conservatives. Young, old, urban, suburban, rural. Gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian. Dean of the Baron. I mean, especially those moments. And especially those moments when this campaign was the most ever. The Afro-Cur-American community stood up for the government. The whole world sees it not right. And I don't know if you'll lose. I said in the outset that I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that I'm still on their midestinction to look like an act. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment. I've lost a couple of dives myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season. The time to build. The time to reap and the time to sow. And the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America would call upon us to moreso the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to moreso the forces of science, and the forces of horror, and the great battles of our time. The battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Beltfrost period, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of a chief racial justice, and ruled out systemic racism in this country. The battle to sing our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of a store of decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Well, our war against from getting COVID under control. We can now, in prayering the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments. Hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the loans that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help us take the Biden Harris Corridor Plan to convert her into an actual blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2020. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin in here and now. We're in fusedle of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests. And that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress.\n",

While our journey has been low, we have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back. And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you vote in for the very first time or waiting in line for a very long time. By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the power. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign. You made your voice heard and you made indepference. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply. And we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Rom to talk about where we can work together and move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Wren and partner of the last 40 years. America's happy and warrior. The best five class of any one you can have. Hope you all. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed of marrying me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I never loved you more. I have never been proud of for what's the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first year. Sasha Malia. For our very eyes. They're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women. Just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now one dollar is probably enough. To the best campaign tea and ball of tears in her history of power. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you haven't been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley. You lifted me up the whole way. And I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos. Or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in a high school gym. Or we saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a child or roof over the head. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections man. It's not small, it's big. It's important. The democracy in a nation up 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times. We make big decisions as a country. It necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Our country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt. That isn't weakened by inequality. That isn't threatened by the disruptive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  To know more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, tasks of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you.

The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation had its north.

      "Transcription:  direction. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell a story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from AuthSeaClock which said that a efficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stateful. Being able to fly, that's crazy. Being able to see overland distances, being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, would be considered magic in time is passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times passed. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff, you know, did a few things here and there, one of which was PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial I thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all of your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and works smoothly. And then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is it. I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close as loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. Going from PayPal, if that's a revolp, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that the sensory root, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the lactarase the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought well if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land sea with sea- some dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hybrid them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life has ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the finished outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the outside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in in late 2000, in late 2000, in 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy, but I did have money. So that was okay. After making silver trips to Russia, I can't see the inclusion. And actually my initial impression was wrong because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond and have a Mars based on that kind of thing. But I can't include that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers. People have came here from other plots in the world. I think the United States is a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then what's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip by Syracuse, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the normal rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical type of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired, but really can't do this anymore tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding, we're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, they're not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at fullplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares, and the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Take lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency, or the snacks in the lunchroom, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that, and that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy right now? The key item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because Natajing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, the fun being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this shit, but now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ebony Bond, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**t. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background and media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up and sorry for turning your introduction here into the segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

I still can't watch it just to find the timestamps for what I put in the video earlier. I have to just download a transfer of it to this. Brock, but it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys to that content that I came up.\n",

Really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that, the century is the century where we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multiplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, I actually initially thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought, well, if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would last with the dehydrate, with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in 2000, like 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. But that's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. After making silver trucks to Russia, I camped inclusion. My initial impression was wrong about that. Because my mission thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond having a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't include that. That was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers of people that came here from other plots of the world. I think the United States is just a distillation of the spread of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then it's going to completely break the federal budget and then up and do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I didn't think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I'm not built like the model rockets as a kid. And I kind of think I never had a company that built any physical set-craft figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like why now? What's going to happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge. Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't the hopefully rate that, sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Iban and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a, I'll call up the manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community, that's you, and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at flipplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. He, Vaughn and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, it's a little make lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lend room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean for all the need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes me kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, be grudging shut out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worked so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about he bought on his the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the lab. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to procure a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Because that is funny, as I think it is, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for putting that up and sorry for turning your introduction ear into this segway to our sponsor. Microcenter.

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Deloarians. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think, Senator Coons is there, and I think the government is around him. Is that Ruth Ann? In that former Governor Ruth Ann Minard. Most importantly, my sister's law, my sister's valouring. Anyway. Well, most people this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, as surprised many, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, unapproving the joy of hope renewed, faithed, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. We'll do just to see Red Stage and Blue Stage only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, sincere home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a test, the test of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without their love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Ashley, and my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, have all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated and liked education, but she is a gesture she does. It's who she is. For a mere good educator, it's just a great day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's gonna make a great first lady. I'm so proud of him. I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't know, she has a least possible in the United States. Small over a new, and we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, done, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary Biden with no way out. Law lobes and you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Lock them elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, law of the volunteers, and all gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. It all lobes, who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition that is to me, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Moderates, Conservatives, Young and all, Irvents, Suburbant, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgendered, White, Latino, Asian, Native American. I made it especially in those moments. And especially in those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African American community stood up for the government. And all we'll see in my daughter, and I'll have you all. I said in the Alex said, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's a lot of the administration to look like an act. I probably won't be able to. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment I had. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, the time to build, the time to reap, and the time to sow, and the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, a mayor of the people called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of hope, in the great battles of our time, the battle of control and the virus, the battle of the Vilprosth barrier, the battle of the secure, your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Whoops! Our war never again took getting COVID under control. We cannot have an apparent economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and Converter into an action blueprint that will start on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought, I try to think, what is the most useful thing that I could, what could I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future? And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Autocie Clock, which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, and that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 1995. That's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. And obviously, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so did some internet stuff. You know, did a few things here and there. One of which was PayPal. And maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and works smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy, and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You know, you want to be as close loop as possible. And so we focused on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you see them. And you're correct your prior assumptions. And then, let me ask you a question. Going from PayPal, I thought of what are some of the other problems. That are likely to most affect the future of humanity. It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to make money. Which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't solve that, the century, the century, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then, I thought, well, what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought, well, if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with the dehydrated, which was seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel, and you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. They thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong. Because my initial thought was that there was not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I came to the conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then, or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve. To solve the space transport problem and started SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. My one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing.

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Um, I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. And this decade began, I was 20 years old and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. No, take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever you got to give it to. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album Speak Now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break up songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Others saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us but you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal styleings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kyoko, King Princess, and the audience, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Distallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Deweleepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. While artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record, and ticket sales, and critical acclaim, so why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought, I started to go, what is the most useful thing that I can, what did I say that could actually help for useful tea in the future? And I thought, perhaps tell the story of how I came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was a young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quirk from Odyssey Club, which said that, especially advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today could be burned at the stake for being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet, a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information, it instantly from almost anywhere near. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. That weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's important that we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. It did a few things here and there. One of which was PayPal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an ennagglomeration of financial services. So it would be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the ennagglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy. And everybody was interested. So I think it's important to take the feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. And then, oh, yeah. The going from PayPal, I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-boarded best way to make money, which is OK. But what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the sensory is the sensory, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX. And the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with dehydrate, which sees the dehydrated nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life of seven travelers, as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the finance outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2000, 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought that the withdraw was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond, if I have a mouse base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. People who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets glowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. It was tough going there in the beginning, because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the model rockets as a kid, and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. It's that guy who figured out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard forked campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I will let her succeed. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous critichers. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure. Which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, conflict. And now, I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on many workmen. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert, they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy, fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. Tomalania and Don. Steve Anker and Eric Antiphany and Baron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great girl. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne, and Chris, and Rudy, and Steve and David, we have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy, Julianne. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. They never changed it. Where's Rudy? Where is him? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, folks. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that's here? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I get to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, Hojji just became single. Welcome to the club. Hojji! Which is you've invested with the divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been to be intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo in the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arianne Phillips, where he is also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Ole May Simon Jones, and the one and only went in Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a bit much really. Oh, and he says that he is going to name this Harry because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\n",

Right, and obviously there's been some kind of mistake, but I'm up here, so if you don't mind. OK. Damian and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we fight over the top. It can tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of amount of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had. On a film, my lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on, so that I could have this experience, which surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you. It's my daughter's, Amada and Esmeralda. I love you. And if I may, I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendes. Thank you very much to the HFBA tonight.\n",

      "Transcription:  To know, for the 200 years after a former colony won the White to determine its own destiny, task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and oppression. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? Or a little in line for a very long time? By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an debt with. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply. We care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son, Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Rinn and partner of the last 40 years. America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Plansonon, Hany Gaudi, can handle hope for Joe Biden. I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first Yagga. Sasha Malit, for poor our very eyes, they're growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. To the best, campaign team and volunteers for her history are powerful. For us. The best, Abra. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. You will have the life long appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in the high school gym, or saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the termination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phone's late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or roof over the head who I make her heart. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are wasting their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. I come to a that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet. And we want our children to live in America that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

Who does not see rents, states, and blue states only sees the United States. To work for all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's united as she had hoped. It's the un-out-my-like time, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without her love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. But it might hurt, she'll have some mom, a military mom, an educator. And she's dedicated her life to education. But she is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For a moment, educators, it's a great day for y'all. You can have one of your own in the White House. The gentleman, that's a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic voice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia descent, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. You're not here to let me, it's not possible in the United States. It's slow over and narrow. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white woman with no way out. All along, you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. In my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built in Rio. I'm proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and the patents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young and old, early and suburban, rural, Gace, trade, transgender, Wayne, Latino, Asia, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments, especially those moments with this campaign was as low as death. The African-American community stood up, I get it for them. We've always seen my brother and I have you, folks. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration who looked like an actor, all of us have you in. Who learned from President Trump, I understand you're disappointed, neither. I've lost the couple of times myself, but now let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the horsewredder at lower than temperature. Let's see each other again, let's see each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The violent tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America called upon us to morph into the forces of decency, the forces of failures, to morph into the forces of science, and the forces of hope. In the great violence of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Bill Cross Berder, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. In the battle, the same old planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our world began to get in control of the world. We can now prepare the economy, restore it by talisman, or relish life's most precious moments of getting our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all along with some matter most of us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris Covert planning converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. While I will govern as an American president, I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim error of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Immigration is dealing with flawless Belt était Всеist remain ... In 2010, Jefferson destroyed a disintegralая of racing Lt.从在路里开始 that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests and that's the choice I'll make and I'll call on Congress.\n",

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Take it. Hey. APPLAUSE Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award, with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You've got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback. But I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would work constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along. And I would keep accommodating, overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. OK, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now, they're saying my album, Red, is filled with too many break-ups songs. OK, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. So they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. OK, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? It's a... Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. OK, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business moment. OK, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. OK, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Monica Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you very much. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Ear at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kioco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan D'Estalion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Fur, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements, women in music, on stage or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings. Because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dongeo? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate. As it...\n",

Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, heard you just became single, welcome to the club. Oh, oh, wishing you the best with the divorce settlement, blah, blah, blah. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Old Mate Simon Jones and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. Applause. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's a bit much really, oh, and he says that he is gonna name this Harry because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\n",

      "Transcription:  To know more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny. Test of perfecting our union, boost forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you we affirm the spirit that has triumphed over war and the question. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of the spirit of the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams. We are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. It has one nation and it's nothing. Tonight in this election you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard. While our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? For a little inline for a very long time. By the way, we had to fix that. Whether you pound in the pavement or take up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Rammi sign, you made your voice heard and made undeprised. I just spoke with Governor Ronny and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a heartfelt campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also informed the city down with Governor Ronny to talk about where we can work together in this country pool. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last 40 years, America's Happy Warrior, the best Vice President, King Yvonne and Hukbo, Joe Biden. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of what's the rest of America fall in love with you too. Because our nation's first the I. Sasha Malayet, for poor or very eyes, they're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud to be guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably none. To the best campaign team and volunteers in her history of howl. That's the best ever. Some of you renew this time around and some of you haven't been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. You will have the life long appreciation of a grateful President. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. Net provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road line in a high school gym, we saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections, man. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best foods and the best teachers. Our country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burned by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard for a campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I owe that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. It's done. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgot men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airport schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got been so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll go through it. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny. And dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things. And successful plans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic, victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on Moonright Moon. Great proof. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're all there. They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's okay. And also my late brother Fred, great, fantastic, great, fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric. Antiphany and Barron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you it's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. And that Rudy never changed. Where's Rudy? Where is it? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie folks was. Thank you. The first man for Senator, for his major, major politician. Let me tell you he is highly respected in Washington. Because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the show up? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor. Because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

Welcome to the club. Oh. Routine, you're the best with the divorce settlement. La, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he has always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says, he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo, and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. His old makes, Simon Jones, and the one and only Quentin Tarantino.

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. And remember that, Larry C.C. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. I have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. Time. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. From Mendis Patrachio, I've got to know our country so well from Mendis Patrachio, it's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. So, forgot men and women of our country will be forgot no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airport schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure. Which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond how we reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny. And dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great movement. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanna Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. He should all be on this stage, but that's okay. Very great. And also my late brother, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tomalania and Don. Andy Vanka. And Garrick. And Tiffany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kelly Ann. And Chris. And Rudy. And Steve. And David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. And that Rudy never changed. It's a risk-routing. Where is him? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, girl. The first man, first senator, first major major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington. Because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Thank you. Great man. Another great man. Very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the channel? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor.

So if you don't mind. OK. Damien and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what peace and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top. It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people. And there's just no time to think everyone. I just like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on, so that I could have this experience, would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you. It's my daughter's amada and Esmeralda.

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Uh-huh. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first thank Bill Bord from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Bill Bord for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry. And I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do, is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires for inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When fearless did win album of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice, was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would twerk constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating. Overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakups songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989. Oh, you heard it. Fag. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation, and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. Now, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this, who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alma the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella May, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us, made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity, coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate. As it...\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Footplay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And Chief Among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. I'm tired and if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We've thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now, like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're now going to get to that leader. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I don't have a really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've all and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having them work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at FloatPlanet.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. You've on and I are still the soul shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives for our kids to do that and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, it's because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our missions complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me well, whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge with that. And that is by design. You've all and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you was actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position because that engine meat is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's want to be only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybony who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Because that is funny as I think it is, you know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker. If you want to go dig up something his old articles for fun, sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up. I'm sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Micro Center.

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could work with, I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othessey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stakeful, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the wealth information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, it would be considered magic in time has passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagine in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always said sort of a slight existential crisis. So I was trying to figure out what does it all mean? Like what's the purpose of things? And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles. Basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's the you, fortunately, we're past graduation. So I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. There are a few things here and there. One of which is PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to, let me say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we have like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments, which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You know, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you see them. And you're correct, your prior assumptions. And then, oh, it's going from Paypal. I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-warded best way to make money. Which is okay, but what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we're doing so, the sensory work wouldn't be trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the lateral basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, and you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. But public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life-sever travel as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited and therefore increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in the late 2000s, in the late 2000s, in the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was that was okay. And after making several trips to Russia, I kept inclusion. That did actually, my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people that came here from other plots in the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I built like the model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. It's that kind of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters and my sisters and my sisters, Valerie. Anyway. Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states only sees the United States. And work for all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, it's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill and my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren. And their spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated to her life to education. But she teaches it just what she does, it's who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's going to make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President. He just served from Kamala Harris. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of an immigrant. Ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's long overdue. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family. You're becoming honorary Biden. There's no way out. All those of you volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers. And all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Modders, Conservatives. Young old, Urban, Suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments. And especially those moments with this campaign was that as low as they ever. The African-American community stood up again for a minute. He's my banner. And I'll have yours. I said at the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what I think the administration will look like and act like. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. Americans have called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of fairness. The forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint. That will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim air of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I owe that for her sincere. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life on business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So Mendez Patensil, I've gotten to know our country so well from Mendez Patensil. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, or veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage that tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. And go, I'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world to me anity that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on moon right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth. We're here with us tonight. And wherever they're here someplace, they're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They are great. And also my late brother Fred, great guy, fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Derek and Tiffany and Barron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Julianne. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. That route had never changed. It was Rudy. Where is it? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Paul. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Thank you. Thank you. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor of the tune up? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor, because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

Ryan obviously has been some kind of mistake, but I'm up here, so if you don't mind. OK. Damian and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top? It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. So, Ars, thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweetheart, thank you.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Floatplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like, really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I have some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. And I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I'm not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives. For our kids to do that. And for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it. And there were a few reasons for that. First is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do? Buy an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivon and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first. We want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then. Who the hell is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really. One of our other colleagues, be grudging shout out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shout out Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. Damn, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Yvonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail. And not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up. And sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

I still can't watch it just to find the timestamps for what I'd put in the video earlier. I had to just download a transcript and it's just rough. But it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys the best content that I can.\n",

      "Transcription:  I absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a... It's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think, Billboard, from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 21 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you are male producer or a co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I could stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo Rosalia Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan B. Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, LMA, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling, standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Currently there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Five days coming up, luckily Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our world compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, sorry, first I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've on and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Ivan and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who may hell's this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and, I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. And I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just a deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. The super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at EOSECR. If you want to go dig up some of the sold articles for fun, sorry, Taren. Sorry for putting you mad up. Sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

Rocked, but it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bring you guys the best content that I can.\n",

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. On this decade began, I was one years old and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be better, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Well, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award. With that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before, as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, but just clever. You've got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now, and that I would twerk constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. They're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. Do you heard it? Fig. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it.

Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in the Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Keoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Colesie, Megan B. Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, Ella May, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it.

      "Transcription:  corruption. So I thought I tried the word what is the most useful thing that I could what did I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell a story of how I came to be here how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what it's going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is this is stuff that that really would be magic or be considered magic in time is passed in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagined in time's past they weren't even in the realm of magic so that it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology then that's like magic and I would be really cool and that the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean like what's the purpose of things and I can't really conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and that's really the only way forward so so I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how how the economy works and you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participating in the internet and be a part of it so I decided to drop out now it's the you fortunately we're we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so did some internet stuff a bit of few things here and there one of which is PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was was kind of how it started because initially the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we show the show the system off to someone we'd show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which is quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment no you want to be as close to live as possible and so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we would probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions and then the going from Cape Al at the will what what is some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to to make money which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem with Gaunt is sustainable energy both the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't sell that the sensory is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make five multi-planetary so that's that's that's the basis for the the latter is the basis for for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and and solar city and and when I started SpaceX it actually initially I thought that well there's there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow something called Mars Oasis which would land seeds with dehydrate with with season dehydrated nutrient gel you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on the red background and the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the first the life of travel as far as we know and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase at NASA's budget so so obviously we can ask outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 like 2000 one 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the Nick that's a lot more and that was 10 years ago I guess so they they they Mithura was crazy but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to inclusion that did actually my initial impression was was wrong about that because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars based and that kind of thing but I can't there's not that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other plots the world I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but if people think it's impossible then or it's gonna completely break the federal budget then they're not gonna do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to but one friend maybe sit down and watch a bunch of videos rockets glowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think it was it was tap going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I built like for the Marvel rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built an even physical set up figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and so we did all that and and then failed three times\n",

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard, and a Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I remember that very soon she met me. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So, Mendis potential, I've got to know our country so well from Mendis potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. So, forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18 month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent. For the benefit of all, it's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clings once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents who I know are looking down on the right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're over. They're here some plants. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother Fred, great job. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tomaladia and Don. And Ivanka. And Eric. Antiphany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through a meeting. He said, Rudy, never change it. Where's Rudy? Where is him? I'm rooting. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was humble. Thank you, Joe. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor of the channel? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could work with, say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how what would this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what it was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othsy Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth, this is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic so that it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, you know, if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and that would be really cool. And I also had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. So I did some internet stuff, did a few things here and there. One of which was Paypal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of Paypal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought with Paypal was to create an agglomeration of financial services to be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, live as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and you're correct your prior assumptions. And then, going from Paypal, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the century were in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for space X and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started space X, I actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with D-hydrate with C-s and D-hydrate at nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing, and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the refinash outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. And so anything better than that was on the upside. And so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2001, 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So they thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was okay. After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond growth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. If people came here from other plots of the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then at or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the one with rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built anything physical. It's had that figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

Okay, he starts by saying, hey Britain, how'd you just became single? Welcome to the club. Oh. We should invest with the divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he has always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips, but he is also tight jeans.

      "Transcription:  I've just received, they call, from Secretary Clinton. She can graduated us. It's about us, one-hour victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I'm very, very sincere. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Done. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which they will worry a few people. I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, our was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement. Made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I'm spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So, Mendez Patentio, I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got many, so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, or veterans, or incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage the tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clings once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. While people and all other nations, we will see common ground, not hostility, heartmorship, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents who I know are looking down one man right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're over. They're here some plants. They're very shy actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on the stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tamalania and Don. And Ivanka. And Eric. And Tiffany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.

      "Transcription:  I absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Um, I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was two years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music, and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and I saw that you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you're male producer or a co-writer, is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, let's take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, people had something to say about me. I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics, when Fearless did win Almabier at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award. And that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news I've come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? Fig. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticite. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And not example should inspire all of us. The only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezvit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Do Alipa, Ella May, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists and music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to advocate advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top. It could tear us apart, but the point is you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there's just no time to thank everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you. It's my daughter's Amada and Esmeralda. I love you. And if I may, I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendez. Thank you very much to the HFPA. You're right.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people have brought me the dance, deliwarians. I see Martin Buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And now the former governor Ruth Ann Minner, most importantly my sisters and all my sister-ballering anywhere. Brothers, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most bubbles ever cast from presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, as surprised me tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide or unify. We'll do just to see reg states and who states, only sees the United States. I work with all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. That's you not going to see it hold. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not free here, without her love, entirely support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, an military mom, an educator, and she is dedicated in her life to education. But Tisha is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's the great day for you all. You ain't have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's for the American, great first lady, I'm so proud of them. Now, having the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president, you just heard from Kamala Ayers, who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first daughter of an immigrant, and her elective in this country. You don't know how to leave, not possible in the United States. Slow over now, and we're reminding to know that you're the only one who's been in this country of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, done, like it or not, your family. You're becoming honorary Biden, there's no way out. All those who you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic, love the elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, and all the volunteers, and all who gain so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we build, REN, I'm proud of the coalition we've worked together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Modernist, Conservatives, Young and Old, Irvin, Suburban, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgender, White, Latino, Asian, Native Americans, I'm maybe, especially those moments, especially those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African-American community stood on the fucking head for more than a minute. We've always seen nothing but, and I'm out of your rules. I sit in the alley set, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that, now that's not the administration to look like an actor. I probably love some human, who voted for President Trump. I understand the disappointment in the night. I've lost a couple of dives, myself, but now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, and this will each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. They are Americans. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, a marriage that's called upon us, to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great valleys of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieved racial justice, and ruled out systemic races in this country. The battle of the same arc planet by getting climate under control, the battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our worry gang can be a threat to the world, our worry gang can get in trouble under control. We can now in preparing the economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get in under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors, who take the Biden-Harris-Covid-Planet-Converter into an action-vulp rent that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, or be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American President. I'll work as horror for those who didn't vote for me, as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The Democrats and Republicans have republished the Co-op rate. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I think that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began I was 20 years old and I had put out my self titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically if people had something to say about me I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Elm of the Year at the Grammys and I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of push back but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. Alright. Okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No. That criticism is reserved for us. But you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo. Rosalia. Taylor Parks. Julie Kiyoko. King Princess. Camila Cabello. Halsey. Megan Vistallian. Princess Nokia. Nina Nezbit. Sigrid. Normani. Her. Maggie Rogers. Becky G. Do Alipa. Ella May. Philly Eilish. And so many other amazing women who are making music right now. No artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  Oh, okay. Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligations, so he asked me to read his response for him. Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, how'd you just became single? Welcome to the club. Oh, Britain, you're the best with the divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank for uses David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arian Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Ole May Simon-Jones and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, it's a bit much really, oh, and he says that he is gonna name this Harry because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\n",

      "Transcription:  So now, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The belief that we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back and we know in our hearts. But for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time, by the way, we had to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made indeporous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a heart-fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country full. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last 40 years, America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Pleasanton, Kenny Valdek and I hope you all have a great day. I would not be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of you for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first yay. Sasha and Malia, before our very eyes, they are growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women just like your mom. And I am so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. So the best, Campaignant Tourhh Bless Ava Some of you were new with this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made to get. You will have the life on the appreciation of the grateful President. Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of eagles or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the rope line in a high school gym, we saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the Lopthalotto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. The port, the math, the sea and the nation up 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's people. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality. It isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people of Guatemala made the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpardown there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sister's along my sister, Valerie, and that, it was. Bubbles, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most of those ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me. Tonight, we're seeing all of this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better name. And I am humbled by the trust in confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who does receive ring states and blue states, only sees the United States. I work for all of my horror, so the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not going to see it whole. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sussman. And I look now at the figure, without their love and tireless support of Jill, and my son Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my horror. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She's dedicated and life-deducation, but teaching is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's going to make a great first lady, I'm so proud of her now. Well, having the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president, you just heard from Kamala Ayers. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first door to every immigrant's ever looked at this country. You know what, no tell me, it's not possible in the United States. It's all over now. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard, for so many years, to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white man with no way out. Well, long time you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers, and all gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. The dollos who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, Ray, and proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republican independence, Progressive, moderate, conservative, young and old, Irman, suburban, rural, gay, straight, straight, gendered, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African-American community stood up against the government. And I'm almost in my night, and I'm having you, Rose. I said in the Alex said, I want to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what the administration will look like and act like roll-loves of you. Who won't represent a drum? I understand the disappointment like that. I've lost a couple of times myself, but now let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen each other again. And the main progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America has cloned upon us to the force of the decency, the force of the fairies, to the force of the science, and the forces of hope, and the great balance of our time, the balance of control of the virus, the balance of milk frostbari, the balance of the secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle of the same old plan might get a climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our worry gets you getting COVID under control. We cannot prepare the economy restored by Taliban or really life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of meeting scientists and experts as trade-dition advisors to help the Biden-Harris COVID-19 Converter and to an active blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. The airplane will be built on bedrock science, but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control, it's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call up Congress, Democrats, Republicans, Democrats, Republicans, Democrats.\n",

Ho, did you just became single? Welcome to the club. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, Who's seeing you vest with the divorce settlement? La, la, la, la.

So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo, and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arian Phillips, but he is also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for this. He is, oh, makes Simon Jones and the one and only went in Tarantino.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Full Plane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking... This feels ridiculous and I've never really outbrewed that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, many of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. They can really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't. Fairfuly rate that sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You want and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Hivon and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money will make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I can be my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, in compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping in to undermine him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break something really all the how-dats. With bad out of the way, then, who else is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So, this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and me, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and dealt, both of which have been successful enough, but they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. If I'm excited to work with my friend again, I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, female source of tech information on the left. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for putting you mad, I've been. Sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

But it might give you guys a better idea of the headspace that ultimately led me to give up the reins so that I can focus just on my love of tech and bringing you guys to that content that I can.\n",

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard fort campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I mean that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, hours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They are great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. The Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Chris. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. Hey, that Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Very strong. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the Chatta? Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

      "Transcription:  To now, for the 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, test a perfecting our union, boost forward. In most forward because of you, in most forward because you re-abirm the spirit that is triumphed over war and oppression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation had a year. Tonight in this election, you, the American people, remind us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have bought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. Oh, I thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you vote in for the very first time or wait in line for a very long time, by the way we have to fix that. Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the bomb, whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an japerous. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Fran and partner of the last four years. America's Happy Warrior, the best-mife pleasant and anything ever. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first year. Sasha Malia, for our very eyes, we're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys but I will say that for now one dog's probably in them. So the best campaign tea and ball of tears in the history of our world. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the life long appreciation of the great president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of butter for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest to be goes or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out of our rallies and crowded along the road line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is waiting through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism and the voice of a military spouses working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job for a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are risking their lives right now, just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Up country that leads up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people abroad made the dance, Delawareans. I see Mike Buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? Annabte former Governor Ruth Ann Minner? Most importantly, my sisters long my sister, Valerie, and Adiwork. Globos, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we the people, we won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket, and the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, a surprise may, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president, who seeks not to divide, but unify. We've got to see red states and blue states, only sees the United States. And work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's you not enough's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the worker making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure, without her love, entirely support of Jill, and my son Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my aunt, Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated to life education, for teaching as a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's for the American, great first lady. I'm so proud of him. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just served from Kamai-Arts. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't not tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's all over now. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamai-Dum, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white man with no way out. All of us who you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic, look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all gave so much to themselves to make this move possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. But all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and defendants, progressive moderates, conservatives, young and old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, dating the marion. I made it, especially those moments, and especially those moments with this campaign was as most as the African-American community still doesn't forget that for me. And all this has not gotten out of my world. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent a look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration to look like an act like Donald Trump's a mutant. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment lately. I've lost a couple times myself, but now, let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. The Bible tells us to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of virus, the battle of the Vilprosperia, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice and rule out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hope's our war we're getting to getting COVID under control. We cannot prepare the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors. To hell, take the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and convert it into an active blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America, begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we may. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests. And that's the choice I'll make. Call up Congress, Democrats.\n",

I congratulated him at Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply. And we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Walnut family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Ron to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last 40 years. America's Happy Warrior, the best life pleasant. Can you go to the end of the whole show, Bob? And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed of marrying me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too, as our nation's first day I can give you. Sasha and Malia, for poor our very eyes, they're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dollar is probably enough. To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of the Palafate. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you had been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the lifelong appreciation of the great-for-president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out our rallies crowded along the road blind in a high school gym, you'll find folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism and the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now, just for a chance to argue about the issues that men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that is burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet. We want our children to live in America that is burdened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me to dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minder. Most importantly, my sisters and all my sister-vallering, Delaware. Fulves, the people this nation have spoken, they delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, with one with the most votes, ever cast some presidents of ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide what unify. Who does receive rent states and loose states only sees the United States. To work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of him. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, seared whole. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, detest of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without their low and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Axe and my daughter, and all our great children, and their spouses, and all our family. That in my heart, Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She's dedicated her life to education, but she is a jester, she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's a great day for you all. You don't have one of your own in the White House. The children of the men can be great first lady, I'm so proud of them. I'm so proud of them. Well, I'll have the honor of serving with the fantastic Vice President, be just served from Kamala Airs. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. You don't know how many of us, not in the hospital in the United States? We're so proud of you all, and we've been to the United States for so many years, to make history. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years, to make this happen once again, America's bent the org for the more universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, But all along, you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Look to elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all of the gates so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Moderates, Conservatives, young, old, Irvents, Suburban, rural, Gay, straight, transgender, weight, Latino, Asian, Native Americans. I mean, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as most, the African-American community stood up against the government. And I want to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what the administration will look like and act like for all moms of you. Before the President Trump, I understand the disappointment like, I've lost a couple times myself. But now, let's keep each other in peace. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. The mouth of this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this America has called upon us to more so the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to more so the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great battles of our time, the battle of control of iris, the battle of the built-prost spirit, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieved racial justice, and Rudatta systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle of restored decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Hooks are worried again to getting COVID under control. We cannot in prayer in the economy, restored by talent, but really it's life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. The Monday I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden Harris-Coward Planet converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but we constructed out a compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I worked as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We infuse the Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we may, and we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And out of the way that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people, they want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

Okay, he starts by saying, hey Britain, how did you just became single? Welcome to the club. Oh. Oh. We're seeing you vest with a divorce settlement. La, la, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arianne Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. His old makes Simon Jones and the one and only went in Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creative Warehouse, and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous. And I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, a wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. We really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what is very pretty right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera and just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at Floplink.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is the honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lent room, or the warranty on the back pack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivan and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. Integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team, beyond that though. The buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. But that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because netting me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, the grudging shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've afforded all of my previous attempts to hire him. So usually since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I've talked to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go... I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the female source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bulls**t. This super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at Yo-Sekr, if you want to go dig up something z old articles for fun. Sorry, Terran. Sorry for bringing that up and sorry for turning your introduction here into this segway.

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. People have probably been dead to Delawareans. I see Mike Bunty, Senator Tom Carpord down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Leonard. Most importantly, my sisters longed my sister Valorant. And they were. Fubless, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the next teeth of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it's surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, are not forming a joy of all of renewed faith in tomorrow. Bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide and but unify. Who does who seek red states and blue states only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart for the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America I believe is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. That's united us here at home. It's the other my like time that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill Sussman. And I look not fear without their love and tireless support of Jill and my son Hunter and actually my daughter and all our grandchildren and its fathers and all our family. That my heart. Jill is a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated and liked education. But she is a gesture she does. And she is. For American educators, this is a great day for y'all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The children of America, great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. We make history as a first woman. First black woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of Remembrance. Ever elected in this country. Y'all look at how little need is still possible in the United States. Small over and over. Have we reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc for the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, why can't I not? You're family. You become an honorary Biden. There's no way out. Well, all along, we volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. We'll elect officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, Rand. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, and the Fedants. Progressive, modern, conservatives. Young, old, urban, suburban, rural. Gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian. Dean of the Baron. I mean, especially those moments. And especially those moments when this campaign was the most ever. The Afro-Cur-American community stood up for the government. The whole world sees it not right. And I don't know if you'll lose. I said in the outset that I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that I'm still on their midestinction to look like an act. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment. I've lost a couple of dives myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season. The time to build. The time to reap and the time to sow. And the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America would call upon us to moreso the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to moreso the forces of science, and the forces of horror, and the great battles of our time. The battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Beltfrost period, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of a chief racial justice, and ruled out systemic racism in this country. The battle to sing our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of a store of decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Well, our war against from getting COVID under control. We can now, in prayering the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments. Hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the loans that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help us take the Biden Harris Corridor Plan to convert her into an actual blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2020. That plan will be built on bedrock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. I will vote for the president who did. I will vote for the president who did. I will vote for the president who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin in here and now. We're in fusedle of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interests. And that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress.\n",

      "Transcription:  Tonel for the two hundred years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny. The task of perfecting our union boosts forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and oppression. The spirit that has led to this country from the depths of the spirit of the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams. We are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. Tonight in this election you, the American people, remind us that while our road has been hard. While our journey has been low, we have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back. And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. Whether you vote in for the very first time or waiting in line for a very long time. By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pound in the payment or picked up the power. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign. You made your voice heard and you made indepference. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We may have battled fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply. And we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Rom to talk about where we can work together and move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Wren and partner of the last 40 years. America's happy and warrior. The best five class of any one you can have. Hope you all. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed of marrying me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I never loved you more. I have never been proud of for what's the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first year. Sasha Malia. For our very eyes. They're growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women. Just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now one dollar is probably enough. To the best campaign tea and ball of tears in her history of power. The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around and some of you haven't been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family no matter what you do or where you go from here. You will carry the memory of the history we made together. And you will have the lifelong appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way to every hill, to every valley. You lifted me up the whole way. And I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos. Or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in a high school gym. Or we saw folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a child or roof over the head. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections man. It's not small, it's big. It's important. The democracy in a nation up 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times. We make big decisions as a country. It necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. Our country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt. That isn't weakened by inequality. That isn't threatened by the disruptive power of a warming planet.\n",

      "Transcription:  direction. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could what could I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell a story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from AuthSeaClock which said that a efficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stateful. Being able to fly, that's crazy. Being able to see overland distances, being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, would be considered magic in time is passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times passed. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff, you know, did a few things here and there, one of which was PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial I thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all of your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and works smoothly. And then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is it. I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close as loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. Going from PayPal, if that's a revolp, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that the sensory root, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the lactarase the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought well if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land sea with sea- some dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hybrid them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life has ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the finished outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the outside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in in late 2000, in late 2000, in 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy, but I did have money. So that was okay. After making silver trips to Russia, I can't see the inclusion. And actually my initial impression was wrong because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond and have a Mars based on that kind of thing. But I can't include that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers. People have came here from other plots in the world. I think the United States is a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then what's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip by Syracuse, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the normal rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical type of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and Flowplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired, but really can't do this anymore tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to white garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding, we're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, they're not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at fullplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares, and the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Take lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency, or the snacks in the lunchroom, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that, and that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy right now? The key item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because Natajing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, the fun being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this shit, but now that the deal's inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ebony Bond, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**t. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background and media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up and sorry for turning your introduction here into the segue to our sponsor. Microcenter.

      "Transcription:  Oh, Brad couldn't be here tonight due to family obligation, so he asked me to read his response for him. OK, he starts by saying, hey, Britain. Hojji just became single. Welcome to the club. Hojji. Hojji, the vest with the divorce settlement. La, la, la. He then says, thank you to the academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been to be intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says, he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo, and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Arianne Phillips, but he is also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. He is, oh, makes Simon Jones and the one and only, went in Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, and he says that he is going to name this Harry, because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\n",

      "Transcription:  So I thought, I was trying to think, what is the most useful thing that I could, what could I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future? And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there, because I often find myself wondering how did this happen? So what else, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me, and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Auth C-Clock, which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be, you'd be burned at the stake for being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively, with the internet, a group of mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that, because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically, if I can advance technology, and that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I always said, sort of, a psych existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things? And I can't really conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business, because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as an individual, if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically, to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 1995, and that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, it's the important that we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. So it did some internet stuff, a few things here and there, one of which is PayPal. And maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So it'd be at one place where all of your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. And we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy, and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as close, loop as possible. So we focused on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them. And you correct your prior assumptions. And then, going from PayPal, whether it will, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? Really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't sell that, the century is the century where we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multiplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, I actually initially thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So I thought, well, if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would last with the dehydrate, with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, then you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in 2000, like 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. But that's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. After making silver trucks to Russia, I camped inclusion. My initial impression was wrong about that. Because my mission thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond having a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't include that. That was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers of people that came here from other plots of the world. I think the United States is just a distillation of the spread of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then it's going to completely break the federal budget and then up and do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. One friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I didn't think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I'm not built like the model rockets as a kid. And I kind of think I never had a company that built any physical set-craft figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like why now? What's going to happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge. Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker, wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. Tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't the hopefully rate that, sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Iban and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a, I'll call up the manager and b, the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community, that's you, and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at flipplain.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. He, Vaughn and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, it's a little make lots of it, and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short-term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long-term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency, or the snacks in the lend room, or the warranty on the backpack, or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivana and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean for all the need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who the hell is this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes me kind of uniquely qualified for this position, because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues, be grudging shut out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worked so much more than the last time that I'd go, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about he bought on his the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again, and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the lab. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to procure a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Because that is funny, as I think it is, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well. He formally wrote at NeoSeeker if you want to go dig up some of his old articles for fun. Sorry, Taren. Sorry for putting that up and sorry for turning your introduction ear into this segway to our sponsor. Microcenter.

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Deloarians. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think, Senator Coons is there, and I think the government is around him. Is that Ruth Ann? In that former Governor Ruth Ann Minard. Most importantly, my sister's law, my sister's valouring. Anyway. Well, most people this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most votes, ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, as surprised many, tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, unapproving the joy of hope renewed, faithed, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. We'll do just to see Red Stage and Blue Stage only sees the United States. I work with all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, sincere home. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a test, the test of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without their love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Ashley, and my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, have all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. She is dedicated and liked education, but she is a gesture she does. It's who she is. For a mere good educator, it's just a great day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's gonna make a great first lady. I'm so proud of him. I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. Don't know, she has a least possible in the United States. Small over a new, and we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's vent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, done, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary Biden with no way out. Law lobes and you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Lock them elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, law of the volunteers, and all gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. It all lobes, who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built, ran. I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition that is to me, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Moderates, Conservatives, Young and all, Irvents, Suburbant, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgendered, White, Latino, Asian, Native American. I made it especially in those moments. And especially in those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African American community stood up for the government. And all we'll see in my daughter, and I'll have you all. I said in the Alex said, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's a lot of the administration to look like an act. I probably won't be able to. Who voted President Trump? I understand the disappointment I had. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, the time to build, the time to reap, and the time to sow, and the time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, a mayor of the people called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of hope, in the great battles of our time, the battle of control and the virus, the battle of the Vilprosth barrier, the battle of the secure, your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control, the battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Whoops! Our war never again took getting COVID under control. We cannot have an apparent economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris COVID Plan and Converter into an action blueprint that will start on January 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. Refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. They thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong. Because my initial thought was that there was not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I came to the conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then, or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, OK, what we really need to do here is try to solve. To solve the space transport problem and started SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. My one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. So I'd figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweet art. Thank you.

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just I don't want this to slip and break because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Um, I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. And this decade began, I was 20 years old and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. No, take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever you got to give it to. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album Speak Now and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break up songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Others saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us but you know I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal styleings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kyoko, King Princess, and the audience, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Distallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Deweleepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. While artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record, and ticket sales, and critical acclaim, so why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought, I started to go, what is the most useful thing that I can, what did I say that could actually help for useful tea in the future? And I thought, perhaps tell the story of how I came to be here, how did some of these things happen? And maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was a young, I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me. But then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quirk from Odyssey Club, which said that, especially advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back, say, 300 years, the things that we take for granted today could be burned at the stake for being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet, a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world's information, it instantly from almost anywhere near. This is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. That weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic, and I would be really cool. And I was at sort of a slight existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works, and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something, because it's very difficult to do something as individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles, basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's important that we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. It did a few things here and there. One of which was PayPal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started, because initially, the initial thought with PayPal was to create an ennagglomeration of financial services. So it would be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature, which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the ennagglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we'd show people email payments, which was actually quite easy. And everybody was interested. So I think it's important to take the feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions. And then, oh, yeah. The going from PayPal, I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-boarded best way to make money, which is OK. But what I think is going to most affect the future humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the sensory is the sensory, we're in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multplanetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for SpaceX. And the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low cost mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with dehydrate, which sees the dehydrated nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life of seven travelers, as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited. And therefore, increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the finance outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in late 2000, 2001, 2002, going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought that the withdraw was crazy. But I did have money. So that was OK. And after making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond, if I have a mouse base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. People who came here from other parts of the world. I think the United States is really just a distillation of the spirit of human exploration.

      "Transcription:  I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard forked campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I will let her succeed. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous critichers. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure. Which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, conflict. And now, I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on many workmen. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert, they should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred, great guy, fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. Tomalania and Don. Steve Anker and Eric Antiphany and Baron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great girl. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. They kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne, and Chris, and Rudy, and Steve and David, we have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you. It's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy, Julianne. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. They never changed it. Where's Rudy? Where is him? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, folks. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that's here? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I get to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats.

He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been to be intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before.

      "Transcription:  To know, for the 200 years after a former colony won the White to determine its own destiny, task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and oppression. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope. Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our world has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? Or a little in line for a very long time? By the way, we have to fix that. Whether you pounded the payment or picked up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made an debt with. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a hard fought campaign. We made a battle fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply. We care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son, Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank Mike Rinn and partner of the last 40 years. America's Happy Warrior, the best Mike Plansonon, Hany Gaudi, can handle hope for Joe Biden. I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who had dreamed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of for watching the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first Yagga. Sasha Malit, for poor our very eyes, they're growing up to become too strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I'm so proud of you guys, but I will say that for now one dog's probably enough. To the best, campaign team and volunteers for her history are powerful. For us. The best, Abra. Some of you were new this time around and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. You will have the life long appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way through every hill, through every valley. You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of water for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in the high school gym, or saw folks working late at the campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the termination in the voice of a young field organizer whose work is way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phone's late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or roof over the head who I make her heart. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections matter. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through top times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change after tonight. And it shouldn't. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and destinations are wasting their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers. I come to a that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I know that very soon. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Done. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American Dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. From Mendes Patrenzo, I've got to know our country so well, from Mendes Patrenzo, it's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgot men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got been those so many, over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors or veterans or credible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. And I'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful plans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations, we will see common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now, I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on moving right now. Great movement. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryann and Elizabeth, to the here with us tonight. And where are they? They're here some place. They're very shy actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They are great. And also my late brother friend, great guy, fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don. Andy Vodka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much, really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelieveable Vanessa. Thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such a dreadable support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Unbelieveable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. He had Rudy never changed it with Rudy. Where is it? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie folks was. Thank you. The first man for Senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected and Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man. Very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Rudy. Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson. Where's been?\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And people who are making a dance, Deleuarians. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minter. Most importantly, my sisters and all my sister Valerie had it worked. Well, most of the people this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast a presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. What I must admit is surprised me. Tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, are now pouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide or unify. Who does not see rents, states, and blue states only sees the United States. To work for all of my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that, is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's united as she had hoped. It's the un-out-my-like time, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, a task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not figure without her love and tireless support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and actually my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. But it might hurt, she'll have some mom, a military mom, an educator. And she's dedicated her life to education. But she is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For a moment, educators, it's a great day for y'all. You can have one of your own in the White House. The gentleman, that's a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I'm the honor of serving with a fantastic voice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris. Who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia descent, the first daughter of an immigrant, ever elected in this country. You're not here to let me, it's not possible in the United States. It's slow over and narrow. And we're reminding tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary white woman with no way out. All along, you volunteer and work the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. In my campaign team, all the volunteers, and all games so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built in Rio. I'm proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans and the patents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young and old, early and suburban, rural, Gace, trade, transgender, Wayne, Latino, Asia, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments, especially those moments with this campaign was as low as death. The African-American community stood up, I get it for them. We've always seen my brother and I have you, folks. I said in the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's about the administration who looked like an actor, all of us have you in. Who learned from President Trump, I understand you're disappointed, neither. I've lost the couple of times myself, but now let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the horsewredder at lower than temperature. Let's see each other again, let's see each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies, they are Americans. They are Americans. The violent tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. America called upon us to morph into the forces of decency, the forces of failures, to morph into the forces of science, and the forces of hope. In the great violence of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the Bill Cross Berder, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. In the battle, the same old planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our world began to get in control of the world. We can now prepare the economy, restore it by talisman, or relish life's most precious moments of getting our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduation, all along with some matter most of us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help the Biden-Harris Covert planning converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science, but will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat. While I will govern as an American president, I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim error of demonization in America begin to end here and now. We refuse the Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech, so just I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Take it. Hey. APPLAUSE Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award, with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You've got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback. But I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would work constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along. And I would keep accommodating, overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. OK, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now, they're saying my album, Red, is filled with too many break-ups songs. OK, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. So they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. OK, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? It's a... Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. OK, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business moment. OK, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. OK, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Monica Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you very much. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alba the Ear at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Hayley Kioco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan D'Estalion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, Fur, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, Ella May, Philly Eyelich, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements, women in music, on stage or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings. Because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dongeo? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate. As it...\n",

Okay, he starts by saying, hey, Britain, heard you just became single, welcome to the club. Oh, oh, wishing you the best with the divorce settlement, blah, blah, blah. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he's always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Robert Lonzo and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his also tight jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. Here's Old Mate Simon Jones and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. Applause.

      "Transcription:  To know more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny. Test of perfecting our union, boost forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you we affirm the spirit that has triumphed over war and the question. The spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of the spirit of the great heights of hope. The belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams. We are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation. It has one nation and it's nothing. Tonight in this election you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard. While our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up. We have fought our way back and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come. I want to thank every American who participated in this election. What are you voting for the very first time? For a little inline for a very long time. By the way, we had to fix that. What are you voting for the very first time? Whether you pound in the pavement or take up the phone. Whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign. You made your voice heard and you made a difference. I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him in Paul Ryan on a heartfelt campaign. We made a battle fiercely but it's only because we love this country deeply. And we care so strongly about its future. From George to the North to their son Mitt. The Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight. In the weeks ahead I also informed the city down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward. I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years. America's Happy Warrior, the best Vice President, King Yvonne, and Hukkul, Joe Biden. And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago. Let me say this publicly, Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been proud of what's the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first theater. I am so proud of you guys. Sasha Malayet, for poor or very eyes, they are growing up to become two strong, smart, beautiful young women, just like your mom. And I am so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now one dog is probably none. To the best campaign team and volunteers in her history of howl. That's the best ever. Some of you renew this time around and some of you haven't been at my side since the very beginning. But all of you are a family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together. You will add the life flow and appreciation of a grateful President. Thank you for believing in all the way through every hill, through every valley. If you lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you've done and all the incredible work that you've put in. I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics who tell us that politics nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turn out our rallies crowded along the road blind in a high school gym, you will all folks working late at a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home. You'll discover something else. You'll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who's working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity. You'll hear the prod in the voice of a volunteer who's going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift. You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse who's working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over the head when they come home. That's why we do this. That's what politics can be. That's why elections, man. It's not small, it's big. It's important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy. That won't change actor tonight. And it shouldn't. We have our arguments, we have our mark of our liberty. And we can never forget that as we speak, people and distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues the men. The chance to cast their ballots like we did today. But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best foods and the best teachers. A country that lives up to its legacy is the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow. We want our children to live in America that isn't burned by death, that isn't weakened by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.\n",

It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the song writers and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters and creators. Don't you? Lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  I just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard for a campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I owe that very sincerely. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. It's done. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've got to know our country so well, tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. To forgot men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airport schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got been so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We'll go through it. We'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny. And dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things. And successful plans once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic, victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on Moonright Moon. Great proof. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're all there. They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's okay. And also my late brother Fred, great, fantastic, great, fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don. And Ivanka and Eric. Antiphany and Barron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got, we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you it's been, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. And that Rudy never changed. Where's Rudy? Where is it? Rudy. Governor Chris Christie folks was. Thank you. The first man for Senator, for his major, major politician. Let me tell you he is highly respected in Washington. Because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who was that? Is that the mayor of the show up? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor.

Welcome to the club. Oh. Routine, you're the best with the divorce settlement. La, la, la. He then says, thank you to the Academy for this extreme honor. He says he has always been a bit intimidated over here, given the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Titans that have come before. So this is especially meaningful. He says, he would like to thank producers David Heyman and Shannon McIntosh, the wild and wonderful Zoe Bell, Rob Belonzo, and the rest of the stunt team, the lovely Ariane Phillips for his Oso-type jeans. I'd also like to thank her for those. His old makes, Simon Jones, and the one and only Quentin Tarantino. He goes on by thanking you again and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, he is going to name this Harry, because he is really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\n",

So if you don't mind. OK. Damien and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want.

      "Transcription:  Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Uh-huh. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first thank Bill Bord from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Bill Bord for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out myself titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label, it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry. And I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do, is exactly what I did. Oh, I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires for inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I'd usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When fearless did win album of the year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that win came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice, was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past, I had had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You gotta give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would twerk constantly, work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating. Overcorrecting, in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakups songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989. Oh, you heard it. Fag. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation, and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. Now, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this, who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Yeah. Thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Alma the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion, that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallian, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella May, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us, made us into diamonds instead, and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, while in very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Footplay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny, but in addition to those strengths both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And Chief Among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream, but the truth is while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. I really can't do this anymore. I'm tired and if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role, but I think it really is the best one. We've thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass, but when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now, like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're now going to get to that leader. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I don't have a really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've all and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having them work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They're going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally, maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at FloatPlanet.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. You've on and I are still the soul shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million, 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives for our kids to do that and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, it's because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our missions complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me well, whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge with that. And that is by design. You've all and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way then, who the hell is this guy right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the pitch I showed you was actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes some kind of uniquely qualified for this position because that engine meat is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's want to be only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean if I'm being honest really, one of our other colleagues, begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go, and I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal's inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of his ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Ybony who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Because that is funny as I think it is, you know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail, and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formerly wrote at NeoSeeker. If you want to go dig up something his old articles for fun, sorry, Taren. Sorry for bringing that up. I'm sorry for turning your introduction here into this segue to our sponsor. Micro Center.

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could work with, I say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there. Because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othessey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stakeful, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the wealth information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth. This is stuff that really would be magic, it would be considered magic in time has passed. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagine in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, if I can do some of those things, basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and I would be really cool. And I always said sort of a slight existential crisis. So I was trying to figure out what does it all mean? Like what's the purpose of things? And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles. Basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95. And that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now it's the you, fortunately, we're past graduation. So I can't be accused of recommending that to you. And so it did some internet stuff. There are a few things here and there. One of which is PayPal. And I think maybe it's helpful to, let me say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought was with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services. So if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we have like a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the agglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments, which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. You know, you want to be as close, loop as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on them when you see them. And you're correct, your prior assumptions. And then, oh, it's going from Paypal. I thought, well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-warded best way to make money. Which is okay, but what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. So I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we're doing so, the sensory work wouldn't be trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make five multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the lateral basis for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and Solar City. And when I started SpaceX, it actually, initially, I thought that, well, there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with the season dehydrated nutrient gel, and you hydrate them upon landing. And then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. But public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the birth of the life-sever travel as far as we know. And I thought, well, that would get people really excited and therefore increase at NASA's budget. So obviously, the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. So anything better than that was on the upside. So I actually went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you, it was very weird going there in the late 2000s, in the late 2000s, in the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So I thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was that was okay. And after making several trips to Russia, I kept inclusion. That did actually, my initial impression was wrong about that. Because my initial thought was, well, that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't conclusion that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will, particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. The people that came here from other plots in the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend maybe sat down and watched a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I built like the model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built any physical. It's that kind of figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people who brought me the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy, Senator Tom Carpenter down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Governor Ruth Ann Minner. Most importantly, my sisters and my sisters and my sisters, Valerie. Anyway. Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We've won with the most votes ever cast some presidential ticket in the history of the nation. 74 million. Well, I must admit, it surprised me tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states only sees the United States. And work for all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the sole America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class. And to make America respected around the world again. It's a united, it's here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now the work of making that vision is real. It's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I would not be here without her love and tireless support of Jill and my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren. And their spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, a military mom, an educator. And she is dedicated to her life to education. But she teaches it just what she does, it's who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for you all. You're going to have one of your own in the White House. And Jill's going to make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her. Well, I have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President. He just served from Kamala Harris. We'll make history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to set. The first daughter of an immigrant. Ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States. It's long overdue. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. But once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more toward justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, your family. You're becoming honorary Biden. There's no way out. All those of you volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of the pandemic. Local elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team and all the volunteers. And all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. And all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran. I'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressives, Modders, Conservatives. Young old, Urban, Suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I'm meeting, especially those moments. And especially those moments with this campaign was that as low as they ever. The African-American community stood up again for a minute. He's my banner. And I'll have yours. I said at the outset, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's what I think the administration will look like and act like. For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. Lower the temperature. See each other again. Listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this. Americans have called upon us to march on the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to march on the forces of science, and the forces of fairness. The forces of hope in the great battles of our time, the battle of control of the virus, the battle of the built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieve racial justice, and root out systemic racism in this country. And the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint. That will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim air of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats.\n",

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time. And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I owe that for her sincere. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. Time. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. And this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life on business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So Mendez Patensil, I've gotten to know our country so well from Mendez Patensil. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors, or veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage that tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. And go, I'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big. No challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again. I want to tell the world to me anity that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on moon right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth. We're here with us tonight. And wherever they're here someplace, they're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They are great. And also my late brother Fred, great guy, fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. The Melania and Dawn. And Ivanka and Derek and Tiffany and Barron. I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support. And I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. That's so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meeting. They that rooted, never changed. It was rooting. Where is it? I'm rooting. Governor Chris Christie folks was. I don't know. Thank you. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington, because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Thank you. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor of the tune up? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor, because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

Ryan obviously has been some kind of mistake, but I'm up here, so if you don't mind. OK. Damian and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what piece and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top? It could tear us apart, but the point is, you understand. So, Ars, thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just would like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweetheart, thank you.

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10, wild and very eventful years, I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and Floatplane Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm gonna try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's gonna happen to the channels and the lab? And if not you, who's gonna be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Father's Day is coming up. Luckily, Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge wallet or key case, so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out at the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses and chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like, really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I have some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be Chief Vision Officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about Creative Officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for. Because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our moral compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. And I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't... I'm not really right, but sorry. First, I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. Yvonne and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing. Our ownership structure. Yvonne and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate bio that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We did have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash. 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives. For our kids to do that. And for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it. And there were a few reasons for that. First is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do? Buy an even bigger house? An even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money. Make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this. But you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with, salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever. I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Ivon and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity and compassion, people first. We want to make strong investments in building something that's going to continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then. Who the hell is this guy, right? The key knight among you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tongue. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position. Because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled of administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and I mean, if I'm being honest, really. One of our other colleagues, be grudging shout out to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shout out Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. Damn, I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I'm really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I'm excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about Yvonne, who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just the primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's on boarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Should I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? You know, it doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. He's a super hardworking guy with great attention to detail. And not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has a background in media as well.

      "Transcription:  I absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Ooh! This is sort of a... It's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think, Billboard, from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. So what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 21 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you are male producer or a co-writer is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. I'll take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win out of the year at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever when the award with that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room. At that time I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that I would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it. Sick. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I could stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked up for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthlessly criticized. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo Rosalia Taylor Parks, Haley Keoggo, King Princess Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan B. Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezbit, Sigrid, Normani, her Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dewelepa, LMA, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling, standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Currently there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

      "Transcription:  Most successful companies eventually outgrow the leadership of their founders. And it looks like my time is now. Effective July 1st, 2023 after 10 wild and very eventful years. I will be stepping down as CEO of Linus Media Group, Creator Warehouse, and FlowPlay Media. I'm sure you have a lot of questions and I'm going to try to answer them all here. Like, why now? What's going to happen to the channels in the lab? And if not you, who's going to be around to tell us about our sponsor? The Ridge! Five days coming up, luckily Ridge is having one of their biggest sales of the year. Give the dads in your life a unique and functional Ridge Wallet or key case so they can do dad things like brag about their wallet and keys. Check the Ridge out of the link below and make dad proud. The truth is I was never really cut out to be a CEO. I remember putting it on my business cards in the early days when we had only four employees thinking, this feels ridiculous and I've never really outgrown that. I'm a lot of things. I'm a bottomless pit of creative energy, an excellent motivator and speaker. I'm wicked smart, charming, really funny. But in addition to those strengths, both real and imagined, I have a lot of weaknesses. And chief among them is that I've just never really had the attention to detail or the temperament that it takes to run an organization this large. I touched on some of this during my infamous 10 million subscriber stream. But the truth is, while I did manage to wrap that up with a positive message about finding motivation to move forward, none of those feelings I talked about ever went away. I wasn't built for this and I'm tired. Like really can't do this anymore, tired. And if I try to drag myself through another 10 years of business administration, I know I'm going to destroy myself and probably end up killing the company and the community that I love so much in the process. I'm at my best when I'm pitching new content or product ideas or when I'm problem solving ways to wipe garbage sites like user benchmark out once and for all. And I had some good news. None of that stuff is going to be going away. My new role is going to be chief vision officer, which is a stupid like BS sounding made up role. But I think it really is the best one. We thought about creative officer, but that didn't really encompass what I'm going to be responsible for because my gut and principles are what got us to where we are today. So I'm still going to be charting the path that I think makes sense. We don't want to lose our world compass. But when it comes to the details of how to best utilize our resources to get there, I need some help. I'm sure you have a lot of questions right now like who our second sponsor is. Just kidding. We're going to get to that later. First, I want to talk about what isn't, sorry, first I want to talk about what isn't going to change. And the biggest one is the rest of our leadership team. You've on and I spent the last six months working with them on my replacement, which included having him work for us on a contract basis to ensure that they feel he is a competent manager and be the kind of person who can comfortably integrate into our team. They are going to be continuing to work alongside him to ensure that this transition goes as smoothly as possible. The next thing that isn't going to change is me. I am not going away. You can expect to see me on camera just as much as you used to. I mean, ideally maybe more. Since if all goes according to plan, I'm going to be left to do what I do best, which is engage with our community. That's you and create. Speaking of which, I'm going to be doing a Q&A session about this with the community in the next week or so. Make sure you're signed up at floatplane.com slash LTT so you don't miss it. Also not changing our ownership structure. Ivan and I are still the sole shareholders and directors of the company. So there hasn't been some kind of corporate buyout that's going to force us to sell our souls to cover their purchase investment. We didn't have a substantial offer recently to sell out. And I might as well speak plainly. The offer was $100 million. 60% cash, 40% shares in the acquiring company. Basically, it was enough to live in a beachfront hotel for the rest of our lives, for our kids to do that, and for our kids kids to do the same. We decided not to take it, and there were a few reasons for that. First, is that honestly speaking, it wouldn't really change our lifestyle much. I mean, what are we going to do by an even bigger house, an even faster car? I mean, that's never really been us anyway. Second, is because we love this company and the people in it. And I just don't think our mission's complete yet. I'm not sure that it will ever be. My point is just that our attitude towards money, make lots of it and keep reinvesting and building this thing to do even better. It's not going to change, and you're not going to see the kind of short term thinking that comes from investor pressure. Our long term thinking is just going to come from this guy, instead. On that note, then let's talk about what does change. And this is actually mostly for the benefit of my team who's watching this, but you guys might as well be in on it. The biggest change is in reporting. No one will report directly into me anymore. If there's an issue with salary transparency or the snacks in the lunch room or the warranty on the backpack or whatever, I promise you, I give you my personal guarantee. Trust me, bro. Whatever it is, there is somebody else who's in charge of that. And that is by design. Yvonne and I have laid out a clear set of guidelines for how we want this company handled. With integrity, and compassion, people first, we want to make strong investments and building something that can continue to offer growth opportunities to everyone who's part of our team. Beyond that, though, the buck stops with the new CEO. I'm not going to be stepping into undermining him. And this is a big shift that's going to mean we're all going to need to break some really old habits. With that out of the way, then, who may hell's this guy, right? The keen item on you might have noticed that the picture I showed you is actually from the roast a few years back. So this isn't your first exposure to Mr. Terran Tom. He was my boss when I worked at NCIX, which makes him kind of uniquely qualified for this position because managing me is a challenging task. I am everywhere. Even the most skilled administrators have struggled with it. And he's one of the only people to ever successfully do that and teach me. He and, I mean, if I'm being honest, really, one of our other colleagues begrudging Shadow to Jack. The two of them taught me most of what I know about business, both what to do and what not to do. Shadow Jack. In the years since his departure from NCIX, Terran has done stints at Corsair and Dell, both of which have been successful enough that they've thwarted all of my previous attempts to hire him. Seriously, since pretty much day one, I've been looking for an excuse for us to work together again. And every single time I would talk to him, he was worth so much more than the last time that I'd go. And I guess we're not really ready for this yet. But now that the deal is inked, I am really excited. I'm excited to work with my friend again. I am excited to have a steady hand that I can trust on the tiller of this ship, a second steady hand. I haven't forgotten about the bond who's the only reason I've lasted this long at all. And I'm also excited about the mentorship that he can provide to me again and also to the rest of our team. We are headed into a really exciting new chapter, guys. Better videos, better products, new investments that are going to make us just a deep, primo source of tech information on the web. I'm sure of it. Now, I don't want to say too much more about him for now. Once he's onboarded, I'm sure he's going to want to prepare a little thing to talk to you guys about. You know, it'd be kind of fun. Shall I interview him? Is that as funny as I think it is? It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out. In the meantime, I can assure you that he is zero bullsh**. The super hardworking guy with great attention to detail and not only a ton of experience in the computer industry, he actually has the background in media as well. He formally wrote at EOSECR.

      "Transcription:  corruption. So I thought I tried the word what is the most useful thing that I could what did I say that could actually be helpful useful to you in the future and I thought perhaps tell a story of how I came to be here how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what it's going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and but then eventually I thought the idea of inventing things would be would be really cool and the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and that's really true if you think if you go back say 300 years the things that we take for granted today would be you'd be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with the internet a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth this is this is stuff that that really would be magic or be considered magic in time is passed in fact I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that were to even imagined in time's past they weren't even in the realm of magic so that it actually goes goes beyond that so I thought well if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology then that's like magic and I would be really cool and that the I was at sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it will mean like what's the purpose of things and I can't really conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world if we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and that's really the only way forward so so I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how how the economy works and you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as as an individual if it's a significant technology so I originally came out to to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and and I thought well I can either pursue this technology where success maybe may not be one of the possible outcomes which is always tricky or participating in the internet and be a part of it so I decided to drop out now it's the you fortunately we're we're past graduation so I can't be accused of recommending that to you and so did some internet stuff a bit of few things here and there one of which is PayPal and I think maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was was kind of how it started because initially the initial thought with PayPal was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we show the show the system off to someone we'd show the hard part which was the the agglomeration of financial services which is quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we'd show people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested so this is I think it's important to take feedback from your environment no you want to be as close to live as possible and so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work and and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then we would probably would not have been successful so it's important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions and then the going from Cape Al at the will what what is some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-corded best way to to make money which is which is okay but it was really what I think is going to most affect the future humanity so the I think the biggest terrestrial problem with Gaunt is sustainable energy both the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't sell that the sensory is the century where we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make five multi-planetary so that's that's that's the basis for the the latter is the basis for for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and and solar city and and when I started SpaceX it actually initially I thought that well there's there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy but then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow something called Mars Oasis which would land seeds with dehydrate with with season dehydrated nutrient gel you hydrate them upon landing and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on the red background and the public can't respond to precedents and superlatives and this would be the first life on Mars the first the life of travel as far as we know and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and and therefore increase at NASA's budget so so obviously we can ask outcome from such a mission would probably be zero so anything better than that was on the upside so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM because that that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2000 like 2000 one 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets but you can keep the Nick that's a lot more and that was 10 years ago I guess so they they they Mithura was crazy but I did have money so that was that was okay and after making several trips to to Russia I came to inclusion that did actually my initial impression was was wrong about that because my initial thought was well that that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars based and that kind of thing but I can't there's not that that was wrong in fact there's plenty of will particularly in the United States because the United States is a nation of explorers the people who came here from from other plots the world I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration so but if people think it's impossible then or it's gonna completely break the federal budget then they're not gonna do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to but one friend maybe sit down and watch a bunch of videos rockets glowing up let me tell you he wasn't far wrong I think it was it was tap going there in the beginning because I'd never built anything physical I mean I built like for the Marvel rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I never had a company that built an even physical set up figure out how to how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and and so we did all that and and then failed three times\n",

      "Transcription:  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us, it's about us, on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard, and a Ford campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. I remember that very soon she met me. Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division. Have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and Independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one United people. Time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help, so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hardworking men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family. It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will. Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. So, Mendis potential, I've got to know our country so well from Mendis potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. So, forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We are going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans. We've been so loyal and I've got to know so many over this 18 month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent. For the benefit of all, it's going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful clings once again. I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interest first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. For people and all other nations, we will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory. First I want to thank my parents who I know are looking down on the right hand. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful and every regard I had truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Maryann and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And we're over. They're here some plants. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert, my great friend, where is Robert? Where is Robert? My brother Robert. They should all be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great. And also my late brother Fred, great job. Fantastic. Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters, great unbelievable parents. Tomaladia and Don. And Ivanka. And Eric. Antiphany. And Baron. I love you and I thank you. And especially for putting up with all of those hours, this was tough. This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. And Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group. You've all given me such incredible support and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people. And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here. And I won't tell you it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through a meeting. He said, Rudy, never change it. Where's Rudy? Where is him? I'm rooting. Governor Chris Christie, folks, was humble. Thank you, Joe. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get. Senator Jeff Sessions. Great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor of the channel? Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here. Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats. Dr. Ben Carson, where's Ben?\n",

      "Transcription:  description. So I thought I was trying to think what is the most useful thing that I could work with, say that could actually be helpful or useful to you in the future. And I thought perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here, how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how what would this happen. So when I was young I didn't really know what it was going to do when I got older. People kept asking me and eventually I thought that the idea of inventing things would be really cool. And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Othsy Clock which said that a sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And that's really true. If you go back say 300 years, the things that we take for granted today would be burned at the stake for, you know, being able to fly. That's crazy. Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the internet a group of mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the earth, this is stuff that really would be magic, or would be considered magic in times past. In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past. They weren't even in the realm of magic so that it actually goes beyond that. So I thought, well, you know, if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology, then that's like magic and that would be really cool. And I also had sort of a slight existential crisis because I was trying to figure out what does it all mean, like what's the purpose of things. And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. And that's really the only way forward. So I studied physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things, you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works. And you also need to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something because it's very difficult to do something as an individual if it's a significant technology. So I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of electric vehicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries. And that was in 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen. And I thought, well, I can either pursue this tech, this technology where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky. Or participate in the internet and be part of it. So I decided to drop out. Now, unfortunately, we're past graduation, so I can't be accused of recommending that to you. So I did some internet stuff, did a few things here and there. One of which was Paypal. And I think it's helpful to say one of the things that was important then in the creation of Paypal was kind of how it started because initially, the initial thought with Paypal was to create an agglomeration of financial services to be at one place where all your financial services needs would be seamlessly integrated and work smoothly. And then we had a little feature which was to do email payments. And whenever we show the system off to someone, we show the hard part which was the agglomeration of financial services which was quite difficult to put together. Nobody was interested. Then we showed people email payments which was actually quite easy and everybody was interested. So this is, I think it's important to take feedback from your environment. No, you want to be as close, live as possible. And so we focus on email payments and really try to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off. But if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful. So it's important to look for things like that and focus on when you see them and you're correct your prior assumptions. And then, going from Paypal, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity? It really wasn't from the perspective of what's the rank-order best way to make money, which is okay. But what I think is going to most affect the future of humanity. I think the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy, but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner. If we don't thought that the century were in deep trouble. And then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multi-planetary. So that's the basis for the latter is the basis for space X and the former is the basis for Tesla and solar city. And when I started space X, I actually initially I thought that well there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company. I wasn't that crazy. But then I thought well what is the way to increase NASA's budget? That was actually my initial goal. So if we can do a low-class mission tomorrow, something called Mars Oasis, which would land seeds with D-hydrate with C-s and D-hydrate at nutrient gel, you hydrate them upon landing, and then you'd have this great sort of money shot of green plants on a red background. And the public tends to respond to precedents and superlatives. And this would be the first life on Mars, the first that life's ever traveled as far as we know. And I thought well that would get people really excited and therefore increase the NASA's budget. So obviously the refinash outcome from such a mission would probably be zero. And so anything better than that was on the upside. And so I actually went to I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICVM. Because that was the best deal. And I can tell you it was very weird going there in 2001, 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest rockets. But you can keep the nuke. That's a lot more. And that was 10 years ago, I guess. So they thought I was crazy. But I did have money. So that was okay. After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that my initial impression was wrong about because my initial thought was that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond growth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing. But I can't think that that was wrong. In fact, there's plenty of will particularly in the United States. Because the United States is a nation of explorers. If people came here from other plots of the world, I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration. But if people think it's impossible, then at or it's going to completely break the federal budget, then they're not going to do it. So after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and start at SpaceX. And this was against the advice that pretty much everyone I talked to. But one friend made me sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up. Let me tell you, he wasn't far wrong. I think it was tough going there in the beginning. Because I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like the one with rockets as a kid and that kind of thing. But I never had a company that built anything physical. It's had that figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of people. And so we did all that and then failed three times.\n",

      "Transcription:  I absolutely love this one, right? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! This is sort of a, it's not a short speech. So just, I don't want this to slip and break, because it's very important to me. Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. Um, I'm Taylor. Good evening. I want to first think billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for, whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent. Okay. I want to say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their woman of the decade. Um, so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. Um, when this decade began, I was two years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16, and then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless. And I saw that there was a world of music, and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations and my songs love story, and I saw that you belong with me to number one for the first time. And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you, whether you deserve to be there, whether you're male producer or a co-writer, is the reason for your success, or whether it was a savvy record label. It wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror from my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did. Oh, let's take it. Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems. And the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, people had something to say about me. I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics, when Fearless did win Almabier at the Grammys. And I did become the youngest solo artist ever win the award. And that when came criticism in backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had co-writers in the room. At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash, which is clever. You got to give it to him. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieved success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news I've come some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then. So then I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right. And then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and I would keep accommodating over correcting in an effort to appease my critics. They're saying I'm dating too much in my 20s. Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single for years. Now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs. Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music. All right. Okay, here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 1989. You heard it? Fig. Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that too. Now I'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart business woman. Okay, I'll disappear from public view for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you. Okay, here's an album called Reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere. In the last 10 years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked out for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist? I really like his songs but I don't know what it is. There's just something about him I don't like. No, that criticism is reserved for us. But you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this. Who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art? I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was Ruth Lee Criticite. Yes. Thank you. We have similar tastes. I like it. She was Ruth Lee Criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner of music. And this year her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys because she just kept making art. And not example should inspire all of us. The only way forward is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us. And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry. Whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizo, Rosalia, Taylor Parks, Haley Keoco, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Bistallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nezvit, Sigrid, Normani, Her, Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Do Alipa, Ella May, Billy Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now. Female artists and music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales and critical claim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast. We have to work this hard. We have to prove that we deserve this. And we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, on stage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could have crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to advocate advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in A&R meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room. We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade. And that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand in hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome. Like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you? Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident-loud person, I feel the need to bring it up. And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate.\n",

So if you don't mind, OK. Damien and Emma, this belongs to the three of us. I'll chop it into three pieces if you want. I don't really want to do that because who would get what peace and no one wants the bottom and we'd fight over the top. It could tear us apart, but the point is it's the, you understand. It's ours. Thank you. You don't get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there's just no time to think everyone. I just like to try and think one person properly and say that, well, I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I've ever had on a film. My lady was raising our daughter pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer. If she hadn't have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So sweetheart, thank you. It's my daughter's Amada and Esmeralda. I love you. And if I may, I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of her brother, Juan Carlos Mendes. Thank you very much to the HFPA. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcription:  my fellow Americans. And the people have brought me the dance, deliwarians. I see Martin Buddy, Senator Tom Carp were down there, and I think Senator Coons is there, and I think the governor's around him. Is that Ruth Ann? And now the former governor Ruth Ann Minner, most importantly my sisters and all my sister-ballering anywhere. Brothers, the people this nation have spoken, they've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people, we've won with the most bubbles ever cast from presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million. Well, I must admit, as surprised me tonight, we're seeing all over this nation, all cities and all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy of hope, renewed faith, and tomorrow, bring a better day. And I am humbled by the trust and confidence you placed in me. I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide or unify. We'll do just to see reg states and who states, only sees the United States. I work with all my heart with the confidence of the whole people to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America, I believe, is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. That's you not going to see it hold. It's the honor of my lifetime, that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is really, it's a task, the task of our time. Folks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I look not free here, without her love, entirely support of Jill. And my son, Hunter, and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren, and their spouses, and all our family. They're my heart. Jill's a mom, an military mom, an educator, and she is dedicated in her life to education. But Tisha is a gesture she does, it's who she is. For American educators, it's the great day for you all. You ain't have one of your own in the White House. The Jill's for the American, great first lady, I'm so proud of them. Now, having the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president, you just heard from Kamala Ayers, who makes history as the first woman, the first black woman, the first woman from South Asia, to set the first daughter of an immigrant, and her elective in this country. You don't know how to leave, not possible in the United States. Slow over now, and we're reminding to know that the United States is the only country of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe, more toward justice. Kamala, dumb, like it or not, your family. You become an honorary Bidener no way out. All those who you volunteer to come at me, love the reluctant officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And my campaign team, and all the volunteers, and all of them getting so much of themselves to make this moment possible, I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything. And all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we build, I'm proud of the coalition we fought together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Progressive, Modernist, Conservatives, Young and Old, Irvin, Suburban, Rural, Gay, Straight, Transgender, White, Latino, Asian, Native Americans, I may be, especially those moments, and especially those moments when this campaign was as low as that, the African-American community stood on the back of the head for me. All those who are not there, and I owe you, I sit in the alley, said, I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that's not the administration to look like an actor. I brought all those of you, who voted for President Trump. I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself, but now, let's keep each other in chains. It's time to put away the horse rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, and this will each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans. The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this, America called upon us, to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science, and the forces of hope, and the great valleys of our time, the battle of control of virus, the battle of built prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care, the battle of achieved racial justice, and ruled out systemic racism in this country. The battle of the same art planet by getting climate under control, the battle of restore decency, defend democracy, and gave everybody in this country a fair shot that's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our ordinary gang is getting COVID under control. We can now, in preparing the economy, restore our vitality, or relics life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, wedding, graduation, all the moments that matter most to us until we get in under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisers to help the Biden-Harris COVID-19 Converter into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20th, 2021. That plan will be built on bad rock science, or be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I'll work as horror for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this premiere of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make, and if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. An athlete that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people, they want us to cooperate in their interest. And that's the choice I'll make. I'll call on Congress. Democrats.\n",
