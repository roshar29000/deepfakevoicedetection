# Deep Fake Voice Detection and Speech Identification 

We address two critical challenges in this project to cater to an audience with hearing disabilities:
1. Fake Voice Detection
2. Speech Recognition.

For the first problem, we developed a solution using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and a customized convolutional
neural network (CNN). Our efforts yielded impressive results, achieving over 95% test accuracy, with ResNet18 specifically reaching a remarkable 92.6% test accuracy.

For the second problem, we used bi-directional LSTM and Whisper AI for Speech to Text. Whisper showed a word error rate of only 22% accuracy while the LSTM did not perform well on this dataset with potential for more fine tuning.
